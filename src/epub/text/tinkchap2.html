<p class=MsoNormal>That was one of the moments I remember best during a voyage
that had had its practical beginning about seven years before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a rim man on the copy desk of a morning
newspaper, the <i>Plain Dealer</i> of Cleveland, Ohio, I had a chance at about ten-forty
every working night to peek at the ads the regular subscribers didn&#39;t see until
they got out of bed the next morning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was a benefit I hadn&#39;t even considered when I applied for the job, but during
the summer of 1958 I availed myself of it with considerable appreciation
because Virginia, my wife, and I had decided that at long last our heads were
far enough above water, financially, to permit us to buy a small sailboat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every night when first-edition copies of the paper were
brought up from the presses to the second-floor city room, I took advantage of
the first lull in the night&#39;s work to turn to the want ads listed under
&#34;Boats&#45;Marine Supplies&#34; to see what I could find.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of the ads concerned motorboats; only a
few sailboats were offered for sale and none of these seemed suited to us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We needed a boat large enough to accommodate
both of us, our daughter, Robin, and our son, Douglas, and yet small enough to
keep at our home in suburban Willowick,
in the garage we hoped to have before long.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This would enable us to avoid dockage fees that, at that stage of our
fortunes, would have bankrupted us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
it also meant that the boat had to be centerboard craft that could be rolled on
and off a conventional boat trailer with ease.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A sailboat with a keel sticking down was out of the question as it would
be much too difficult to haul on a trailer.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p5">Page 5</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally, after weeks of looking, I found a promising ad in
the paper of August 2<sup>nd</sup>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                                    </span>SAILBOAT,
13 ½-ft. Old Town, needs</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                                    </span>Some
repair, cheap.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>EN 1-7298.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Getting the drop on the <span class=SpellE>P.D.&#39;s</span>
three hundred thousand-plus paying readers, I dialed that telephone number at
once and made arrangements to see the boat early the next day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It turned out to be a most memorable
occasion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The owner was a fine old gentleman of Greek descent who met
me with a twinkle in his eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the
way he spoke, I could tell the boat had played the same unifying role in his
family that Virginia and I hoped it would play in ours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He and his wife had raised their daughter on <span
class=SpellE>sailboating</span> very much as we hoped to raise our youngsters,
for, in addition to all the other reasons we had for wanting a sailboat, we
listed the character-building part it could have in shaping our children&#39s
personalities.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But my first glimpse of the boat gave me quite a shock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looked so lonely and forlorn turned bottom
up in the owner&#39;s back yard, its bow and stern resting on rough crates.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What struck me like a blow, however, was the
sight of two enormous splits in the hull, one on each side at about waterline level.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were about five feet long and up to a
quarter of an inch wide.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I couldn&#39;t
imagine what had caused them and I didn&#39;t ask for fear of embarrassing the
owner; he was such a nice old man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
cause didn&#39;t matter, anyway; all I needed to know was whether they could be
repaired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sensing that I wanted to examine the boat thoroughly, the
elderly gentleman left us alone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had
said the boat was thirty years old, and she showed her age in her multi-layered
and multicolored coatings of paint, which, in spots, was peeling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the planking, except for the two splits,
appeared healthy and strong.</p>


<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p6">Page 6</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I lay on my back, pushed my head and shoulders under the boat and, as soon as
my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom, studied every nook and cranny of her
interior.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I discovered the &#34;needs some
repair&#34; of the ad was an understatement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nearly two dozen of the boat&#39s steam-bent ribs were broken and half a
dozen others were infected with dry rot, which also had decayed chunks of the
mast step and a portion of the centerboard trunk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The canvas deck was badly worn and needed
replacement, and the sails, as I discovered later, were too mildewed and
threadbare to use.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everything else, though,
was basically sound.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For about forty-five minutes I lay there under the
boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After I&#39;d examined her insides
completely and had decided her split planks were <span class=SpellE>mendable</span>,
I drifted off into woolgathering about our plans for her, fixing her up, the
place she&#39;d occupy in our family and how she&#39d fare with us and we with
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, I got down to the business
of listing all the pros and cons, weighing her cost, a hundred and sixty
dollars, and the expense of repairing her and buying her new sails, which I
estimated would come to around three hundred dollars, against the cost and the
possibility of buying a boat in better condition.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I decided that, dilapidated as she was, she
was the boat for us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I paid a deposit
and told the owner I&#39;d be back soon to pick her up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On August 4<sup>th</sup> (Virginia has the date underlined in her diary) the whole family bundled into our car
and, with a rented trailer hitched on behind, we drove off to take possession
of our little craft.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The owner and his
friendly wife and daughter came out to greet us on our arrival.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We chatted for a few minutes, completed our
transaction, and then everyone pitched in to turn the boat right side up and
winch it onto the trailer.Virginia told me later that, as we drove slowly down the driveway, she noticed tears
glistening in the old man&#39s eyes as he and his wife kissed their hands and
patted the boat with affectionate gestures of farewell.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were sorry to be taking away an object
that had meant so much to them, but at the same time we were happy to know </p>
<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p7">Page 7</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>that, despite its run-down state, the boat had been deeply loved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unquestionably, it had provided this pleasant
family with many happy experiences, and we felt certain it would do the same
for us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Earlier in the day Robin and Douglas had broadcast the news
to their friends that we were going to get a boat, so nearly all the children
of the neighborhood were waiting for us on our return home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They paraded along shouting to one another as
we proudly towed our new acquisition up our driveway, and, from that moment on,
the boat seemed to be surrounded by children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It apparently was a magnet, although I suspect that neighborhood mothers
often told their offspring to &#34;go up and watch what Mr. Manry&#39;s doing&#34; just to
get them out from underfoot for awhile.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway, they seemed to congregate around the boat whenever I was working
on it, which was practically every day between 9:30
 A.M. and 4 P.M., when I
had to stop to have dinner and then leave for my job on the P.D. copy desk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes I was able to pull of a stunt like Tom Sawyer&#39s
the day he had to whitewash his Aunt Polly&#39;s fence, except that I was taking
paint off, not putting it on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39d scrape
away as though the task were sheer ecstasy and pretty soon one of the young
observers would ask if he could share my fun; and I&#39d say yes and give him a
scraper or some sandpaper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then
another would ask, and then another.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Once I had four junior boat renovators working at the same time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually they didn&#39t get a great deal
accomplished; the paint-removal project was arduous.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we all had a good time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I used every minute I could take from the demands of my job,
family and home to work on the boat, for steady progress had to be made if it
was to be ready in time for the 1959 boating season, which opened in May.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, I spent so much time working on the
boat I&#39;m sure Virginia and the
children often wondered whether we had taken possession of it or it had taken
possession of us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must say, though,
that they bore up remarkably well under the intra&#45;family strains created by
occasional conflicts between </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p8">Page 8</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>its needs and ours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like the time I had to soak the ash ribs I&#39d
ordered in the bathtub for five days to make them pliable enough to bend into
place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was a time of tribulation
for everyone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The grim days of having to take sponge baths or none came to
an end as the new ribs were installed and bolted down to the planking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A new mast step was put in next, and the
decayed portion of the centerboard trunk was cut out and replaced with fresh
wood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then those cruel, ugly splits in
the sides were repaired with plywood strips, waterproof glue and fiberglass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During all this time we had to be careful to keep the boat
dry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whenever I wasn&#39;t working on it, we
kept it covered with tarpaulins and old plastic tablecloths.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, of course, the necessity of keeping it dry
made that fall seem like the rainiest one we&#39;d ever had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One night Virginia was ready for bed when I telephoned from the <i>Plain Dealer</i>, as I always
did at about 10:00 P.M., during my
supper hour.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34Is it raining?&#34 I asked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(It was impossible to tell form the <i>P.D.</i> city room, which had no
windows.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34Yes.&#34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34Better make sure the boat isn&#39;t getting wet.&#34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34O.K.&#34</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So my wonderful wife put a raincoat on over her pajamas and
rubber boots over her bedroom slippers and went out into the cold, blustery,
wet night to make sure the boat&#45;this nautical thing that was being treated with
the deference we might have shown a third child&#45;was not suffering from the
dampness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the tarps was flapping wildly, threatening to come
adrift; so Virginia took hold of
an automobile tire we used to weigh the tarps down and heaved it into
position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was an easy operation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She&#39;d done it scores of times before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only trouble was that this time the tire
was full of ice&#45;cold rain water.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p9">Page 9</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Virginia gasped and sputtered beneath the resulting shower, drenched to the skin in
spite of the rain gear she wore, and nearly frozen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a moment of dreadful crisis for me and
for the boat, although, at the time, I remained tranquilly oblivious at my <i>P.D.</i>
post miles away, with nothing more serious on my mind than the split
infinitives and faulty syntax in a reporter&#39;s news copy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t hear of it until the next day, at
breakfast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We passed through such troubled waters as these on several occasions.  However, a
rising tide of good humor always saw us through, as the boat gradually changed
in appearance from an abandoned hulk to a craft that might conceivably return
someday to the element for which it was assigned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our developing plans for the boat were rather
unconventional.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, our intentions
went far beyond simply restoring it to a seaworthy condition.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We wanted it to become our little yacht, to
take us on cruises, which meant that it had to have sleeping accommodations for
all four of us within the meager space provided by its 13 ½ -foot length and 5
¼-foot beam.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seldom has so much been
expected of so small a boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And yet
these expectations were, in a manner of speaking, realized.</p>



<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p10">Page 10</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>The mid-section of the hull was converted into a tiny
&#34;cabin&#34; separated from the cockpit by a watertight bulkhead and
covered with a roof that could be partly opened, to permit entry and use of the
folding-down seats at its rear, or removed entirely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia and I could sleep on air mattresses,
in sleeping bags, in this area; one on each side of the centerboard trunk, with
our feet extending into the bow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next, I built a removable panel that could be fitted over
the foot well to convert the cockpit into a flat space where Robin and Douglas
could put their air mattresses and sleeping bags.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since this cockpit sleeping area was elevated
eight or ten inches above the floor where Virginia and I would sleep, it gave
our accommodations plan a split-level effect that was certainly in tune with
the times, from the viewpoint of home architecture if not naval architecture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naturally we had to consider the weather, for it wouldn&#39;t
have been very pleasant on our yacht in a rainstorm; the joint between the two
sections of the cabin roof wasn&#39;t absolutely rainproof, despite the use of
weather stripping, and would have let water drip below, maddeningly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Besides which, the cockpit double-bunk layout
was entirely open to the elements.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These
difficulties were overcome through the fabrication of a tent we could sling
over the boom and snap to fasteners installed on either side of the boat just
below the rubbing strake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tent
enclosed both cabin and cockpit, giving us all the headroom we needed, as well
as privacy and shelter for cruising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At last, in early May, after more than nine months of toil,
our tiny yacht was ready.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then came the
unforgettable day we brought home our own trailer, pulled the boat onto it for
the first time and, just for practice, pitched the tent to see how it would
look.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looked great; at least, it did
to us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think it would be accurate to
say the boat was unique; and the entire rig, assembled with the tent up, had
the extraordinary appearance of an amphibious Conestoga wagon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robin and Douglas and their friends had a
wonderful time playing in it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
Virginia and I began to feel like pioneers on the </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p11">Page 11</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>threshold of exciting explorations that would add an entirely new dimension to our lives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
could hardly wait to get started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Mother&#39;s Day, Sunday, May 10<sup>th</sup>, was only a day or
two away and I thought what a treat it would be for Virginia if we launched our
boat and went for our first sail on this special day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So that&#39;s what we did; only it didn&#39;t work
out quite the way I&#39;d hoped it would.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We trailed the boat to Cleveland&#39;s
Gordon Park and utilized the public launching ramps there to get it into the water.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That much was easy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then the complications set in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First it began to rain and, for half an hour
or so, Virginia and the children huddled uncomfortably in semi-reclining
positions in the minute cabin to keep relatively dry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There wasn&#39;t room for me in there, too, so I
stayed outside tending the mooring lines and getting soaked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When the rain finally stopped, the wind began to blow with
alarming force.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Frankly, it scared
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even as a novice sailor I realized it
would be dangerous to be out on Lake Erie in such a
stiff and gusty breeze.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we&#39;d come to
sail and sail we would.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At least, one of
us would&#45;me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I felt like Captain Bligh when I told my family I&#39;d decided
to go it alone; under the circumstances, I simply couldn&#39;t be responsible for
the safety of anyone but myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>However, they must have realized I spoke words of wisdom for there were
no significant protests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All three got
out of the boat and into our car and sat there, protected from the wind, eating
the picnic lunch Virginia had
prepared, as the boat and I left the shore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we headed into the maelstrom of winds and waves the words
of Tennyson&#39;s &#34;Crossing the Bar&#34; came to me:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>Sunset and
evening star,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>               </span>And one
clear call for me!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>And may
there be no moaning of the bar,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>               </span>When I
put out to sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It wasn&#39;t the time of sunset, either actually or
figuratively, and there was no evening star in sight, but I could hear that
&#34;clear call for me&#34; and a frightful moaning that filled me </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p12">Page 12</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>with dread.  Fortunately, the moaning was of the wind in the rigging, not of the bar.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was a relief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I didn&#39;t dare to venture far into the lake; in fact, I
stayed within the protecting arm of a nearby <span class=SpellE>breakwall</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even so, it was one of the most breath&#45;taking
sails of my life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The boat whizzed along
so fast that I had to come about every twenty seconds or so to stay within the <span
class=SpellE>breakwall&#39;s</span> shelter, which I was determined to do.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Violent puffs of wind made the craft heel over
so far and so fast that I repeatedly let go of the mainsheet in alarm,
whereupon it would run through the boom block as far as it could go.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only the knot in its end kept it from going
all the way, which would have created a very sticky situation indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In less than fifteen minutes I&#39;d had my fill of sailing
under those conditions and returned to the dock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We soon had the boat back on the trailer and
were on our way home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;It was <span class=SpellE>kinda</span> gusty,&#34; I told Virginia.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Kind of gusty!&#34; she exclaimed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;I was sure you were going to upset.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the waves were so big we couldn&#39;t even
see you when you were down between them!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>All we could see was the tip of the sail!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Yeah.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I guess it
must have looked pretty exciting from the shore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And it sure wasn&#39;t much of an outing for
you.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All you got to do was sit in the
car and watch your husband sail.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You mean watch him nearly drown!&#34;</p>

<p>When we got home, the neighbors hurried out to greet us as
though we had all returned from the grave.  They said that, to tell the truth, they hadn&#39;t expected to see us
again&#45;alive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, I couldn&#39;t afford
to hang around wallowing in the delightful role of a latter&#45;day Lazarus; I had
to eat a quick lunch and rush off to work at the <i>P.D.</i>  Virginia, left with the duty of hanging up the sails to dry, spent most of the evening in
deep reflection, pondering the meaning of Mother&#39;s Day.</p>


<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p13">Page 13</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Undaunted, we set forth again a few days later for another attempt at sailing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was a bright, sunny afternoon and for me a day off from work, which
meant we wouldn&#39;t have to hurry home as we had before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had an opportunity to sail and sail; until
dark, if we wanted to, or even later than that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I&#39;d never been sailing in the moonlight and wondered how it would
be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Marvelous, I guessed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This time we decided to launch the boat at Wildwood Park, nearer our home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We got it off the trailer and into the water
again without any trouble, stepped the mast, then, with what seemed to us an
exceedingly seaman&#45;like flourish, hoisted the sails and headed for the narrow
channel leading from the harbor into the lake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We were propelled by a wind that had had its teeth pulled, a gentle
breeze that couldn&#39;t have hurt a fly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was comforting to know that, whatever else might happen, we had nothing to fear
from <span class=SpellE>Aeolus</span>, god of the winds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But alas, that &#34;else&#34; began happening almost at once.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The boat seemed to have a will of its
own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Refusing to respond to my excited
pushes and pulls on the tiller, it moved with unwavering aim on a course
destined to pile us up on the huge blocks of stone that formed one of the
harbor&#39;s walls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a nightmare vision
of losing my dear wife and children in a grotesque in&#45;harbor shipwreck and of
spending the rest of my days racked by remorse, imprisoned for improper
operation of a sailing vessel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believe
I was as close to skidding into utter panic as I have ever been, and the
children didn&#39;t help to calm my nerves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Both of them hollered in terror, &#34;We&#39;re going to hit the rocks!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We&#39;re going to turn over!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, I retained enough of a grip on myself to get
out the oars.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I gave one to Virginia,
and together we fended the boat off the rocks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then it came to me&#45;I hadn&#39;t lowered the centerboard!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That&#39;s why I hadn&#39;t been able to steer; why
the boat had seemed bent on dashing itself to pieces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In a matter of seconds we had the board down and immediately
almost everything subsided into normality.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I say almost everything because, even though the wind caught </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p14">Page 14</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>our sails and wafted us peacefully into the lake, even though the boat was
now fully under control, Douglas, then not quite five, was far from gleeful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Take me back to the shore!&#34; he yelled at the top of his
lungs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;Take me back!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Take me back!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Virginia and I held a hurried conference.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We agreed that he was truly frightened and,
if we wanted him to grow up enjoying boats and sailing, it would be prudent to
respect </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>his wishes and return to shore, to await a more auspicious time
to start him off as a sailor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So,
without any sailing in the moonlight, or even much sailing in the daylight, we
returned to the dock and set off for home.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For a while Virginia and I saw our hopes of family unity
built on a foundation of happy sailing experiences slipping into oblivion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we persevered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Recalling the horseback riders&#39; dictum to
remount at once after a bad fall in order to maintain confidence, we soon cast
off from home again, this time on an overnight voyage of discovery to Pymatuning Lake,
a fetching reservoir sixty miles east of  Willowick .<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was to be our shakedown camping cruise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When we got to the campgrounds, our fellow campers found us,
or rather our boat, a trifle startling.  In fact, it was plain they had never seen anything like it in their lives.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p15">Page 15</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>A woman at a neighboring campsite watched
spellbound as I prepared our yacht for the night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I hoisted the tent over the boom and
started to fasten it down, Virginia overheard her exclaim to her husband, &#34;George, look!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He&#39;s building a house on the boat!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must confess that, secretly, we were both amused and
pleased by the apparent consternation our little craft caused among the more
conservatively equipped campers who saw it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We loved the dropped jaws and surprised looks it produced.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And we were pleased with ourselves, in a way,
for our refusal, in this one respect at least, to follow in the crowd&#39;s
footsteps like sheep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We enjoyed daring
to be different.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also, on later trips, we found our boat-tent paid unexpected
dividends, for we were allowed to sleep in it offshore at crowded camps where
all the onshore sites were occupied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we settled down for the night at Pymatuning Lake, Virginia,
unknown to the rest of us, began what was undoubtedly the supreme test of her
life, an excruciating ordeal of physical endurance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This terrible night of torture was imposed by
a regulation government&#45;issue sleeping bag, otherwise known as a mummy
sack.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The children and I fell asleep in
our sacks almost at once.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn&#39;t
until morning that we learned Virginia had spent most of the night tugging, turning, twisting and thumping&#45;struggling
to find a comfortable position in the too&#45;tight shroud that encased her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To top it off, she nearly froze; and in
silence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She allowed the rest of us to
go on sleeping, undisturbed, as she played martyr, suffering without a word of
complaint.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even at dawn, when we awoke,
she continued to be brave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The nearest
she came to releasing the inner pressures that threatened to explode was to say
&#34;I take my hat off to the American soldier.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Any man who can go out and fight after spending a night in one of these
woolen booby traps has my undying admiration.&#34;</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p16">Page 16</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>A surge of admiration flowed through me, too, at that moment but it wasn&#39;t for the American soldier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After breakfast we provided our fellow campers and boaters
with a spectacle that no doubt, to them, was hugely entertaining.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It happened as we were launching our
boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was busily engaged in sliding
the boat off the trailer into the water when Virginia,
at the wheel of the car, mistook something I said for the signal that the boat
was launched and the trailer could be hauled away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She took off prematurely with a forward jerk
that sent the boat careening into the water with a mighty splash and me
following after, legs and arms whirling like windmills.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the time she heeded my shots of distress
and looked around, I was on my hands and knees in the lake and the boat&#45;with
Robin, our beloved first&#45;born, on board&#45;was skimming off beyond reach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I swam out and towed the boat back to shore; getting soaked,
but saving our daughter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Meanwhile, Virginia remarked to a camper standing near her that perhaps, in view of the havoc she&#39;d
wrought, she had better start driving and never come back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And he said he reckoned that might be a good
idea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Robin and Douglas thought the whole episode was the most fun
they&#39;d ever had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, it was then
they decided that sailing was a great sport, after all, and began to enjoy it
thoroughly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia and I were a little
slower about savoring the humor of the situation, but as soon as we got under way,
spanking along in our <span class=SpellE>windboat</span> before a fresh breeze,
we regained the capacity to laugh at ourselves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We could imagine how energetically tongues were wagging back at the camp
about the performance of the nutty family with the boat that converted into a
tent, or the tent that converted into a boat, or whatever it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the months that the driveway of our home had had the
appearance of a boatyard, and the weeks since then, our craft had been
nameless.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had been known simply as
&#34;the boat&#34; or as &#34;our boat&#34; or (when its seemingly excessive consumption of
time and /or money piqued other members of the family) as &#34;Daddy&#39;s boat.&#34;</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p17">Page 17</A></FONT></P>
<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'></span>Now, however, the time had come to give it a name and we put our heads
together in a brain&#45;storming session to choose one we all liked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Douglas at that time was tapering off from an amazing
adulation of bullfighters&#45;where he acquired it, I don&#39;t know&#45;and entering a
phase of his life in which he regarded pirates as the most wonderful of men,
the only real heroes worthy of acclaim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He knew more about <span class=SpellE>Blackbeard</span>, Captain Kidd,
Long John Silver, Henry Morgan, Captain Hook and the other factual and
fictional freebooters of the Spanish Main than other
boys his age knew about baseball greats.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He and his friends were constantly playing pirate on the boat, making
imaginary foes walk the plank and sailing off to hidden islands to bury chests
full of treasure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And whenever we went
sailing on Lake Erie or Lake Pymatuning,
we always had to fly the Jolly Roger from the masthead, as befitted a
buccaneer&#39;s sloop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Doug&#39;s love of pirates that led, indirectly, to the
name we chose for our boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It got us to
thinking about Captain Hook, and that led to Peter Pan and Tinker Bell, who, at
one point in J. M. Barrie&#39;s story, was poisoned by Hook and brought to the
brink of death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only thing that
could save her was for the children of the world to affirm their belief in
fairies, which they did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, believing
in our boat fully as much as these children believed in fairies, we decided to
name her after Tinker Bell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We thought
this name was particularly appropriate because, in addition to the connotations
of the fairy tale, it reflected the fact that I was forever tinkering with her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, we changed the spelling to
Tinkerbelle, since the boat certainly was an enchanting belle, although, like
its namesake and all things feminine, it could on occasion be exasperating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Tinkerbelle</i>, now definitely a &#34;she&#34; rather than an
&#34;it,&#34; exhibited her exasperating side on our next cruise, a gunk&#45;holing
expedition to Erie, Pennsylvania, a lakeshore city about ninety miles east of
our home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We launched her in the bay
formed by the curving arm of Presque Isle
 Peninsula and planned to sail through the channel into Lake
 Erie and on to a beach where we could go swimming.  It was a
sunny day and the lapping waves and glistening sails made us feel vigorously
alive.  We looked forward to an
exceptionally enjoyable afternoon.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p18">Page 18</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>All went well until we got to the channel and then the
breeze dropped to less than a whisper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We stopped moving.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i>Tinkerbelle</i>
just sat there motionless as motorboat after motorboat passed by.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When an excursion boat out for a tour of the
peninsula came along, we were admired, photographed and waved to.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then, an hour later, when the excursion
boat returned, we were admired, photographed and waved to again; but this time,
since we hadn&#39;t moved ahead more than a few feet, we also became the butt of
some snide remarks, such as: &#34;Get a horse,&#34; &#34;Why don&#39;t you use a motor?&#34; and
&#34;Maybe you better swim for it.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the
fishermen on the banks of the channel chimed in with caustic comments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Sailing is like watching grass grow,&#34; one of them remarked,
plainly for our benefit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had prided ourselves that, in the great tradition of the
sea, ours was both a happy ship and a taut one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But it didn&#39;t require 20/20 vision to see that the first mate was going
into a maneuver that even in <span class=SpellE>nonnautical</span> circles was
known as &#34;coming to the end of one&#39;s rope.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So, finally, when one of those beastly motorboats offered us a tow, I
accepted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The return trip, after our swim, was just as slow, maybe
slower.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It took us more than twice as
long to sail the four miles from the beach back to the dock as it had taken to
drive the ninety miles from Willowick
to Erie.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Without a doubt, Virginia and the children
earned their Ph.D.s in patience that day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I guess I&#39;d already picked one up somewhere but nevertheless I resolved
that, as soon as possible, we&#39;d get a little outboard motor to use when the
wind faltered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That would make our
seafaring ever so much pleasanter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In June and July we did a lot of day sailing on Lake Erie from launching ramps in </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p19">Page 19</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Cleveland and went on several more overnight trips to other, smaller bodies of water.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, in August, we climaxed the summer with
a seven&#45;day <span class=SpellE>amphibi</span>&#45;cruise through Michigan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Virginia and the kids look back on this as our nonstop
vacation race through Michigan because we didn&#39;t spend more than one night at each place we visited.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nevertheless, the trip became a high spot of
our lives.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our most vivid memories are
of lovely Higgins Lake, where, for the first time, we slept aboard <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
while she was water&#45;borne; of the gigantic Mackinac Bridge connecting the state&#39;s
upper and lower peninsulas; of Manistique, a former logging town which still
has a friendly frontier atmosphere; of Indian Lake in the heart of the Hiawatha
country, where we imagined ourselves camping &#34;by the shores of <span
class=SpellE>Gitche</span> <span class=SpellE>Gumee</span>&#34;; of Traverse City,
where we nestled in a grove of sweet&#45;scented pines, and of Ludington State
Park, where we again spent a night afloat, snug and dry in our boat&#45;tent
despite the driving rain of a thunderstorm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the summers of 1960 and 1961 we continued our day
sailing on Lake Erie and occasional overnight <span class=SpellE>gunkholing</span>
trips elsewhere; but our three&#45;week vacation each summer was devoted to camping
and sailing in the delightfully remote wilds of Algonquin Provincial Park in
Canada&#39;s Ontario Province.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fun we
had living on an island in the park&#39;s Lake Opeongo has left indelible impressions of bliss on our minds, and the sailing
experiences we had there were equally joyful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was on an enchanting blue&#45;sky day on Lake Opeongo,
as we ghosted along in our boat listening to the charming songs of tiny white&#45;throated
sparrows, that we came to the realization, suddenly, that <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
had crept deeply into our lives and hearts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She wasn&#39;t a boat any more; she was a friend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was helping us to grow, individually and
as a family, by bringing us, together, into confrontation with basic forces of
nature and fundamental situations in living.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She was giving us a foundation on which to make wise decisions about
what was important in life and what wasn&#39;t.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span></p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p20">Page 20</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>She was providing experiences through which we were acquiring self&#45;reliance, appreciation for the
outdoors, respect for others, instincts of mutual aid and cooperation and all
the other qualities, skills and attitudes that contribute toward the
development of mature personalities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
was teaching us how to endure what couldn&#39;t be cured.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And she was helping us to avoid some of the
pitfalls that abound in today&#39;s urbanized environment, where the impact of
Madison Avenue&#39;s bullyboy exponents of the hard sell has tended to transfer
human values from their normal climate to a hothouse atmosphere almost totally
unrelated to reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Don&#39;t assume for a second that the children were the only
beneficiaries, or even the principal ones.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Virginia and I gained enormously, too, in our understanding of our
children, of sibling rivalry and how to deal with it, in our comprehension of
ourselves and of each other and in innumerable other ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We didn&#39;t always act with flawless wisdom and
love, we were far too imperfect for that; but we seemed to be moving in the
right direction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, I hoped we
were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And we owed a debt of gratitude to our boat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was accomplishing for us what we had
originally hoped she would accomplish, and more.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This does not imply that these things might
not have been achieved equally well, or even better, in some other way, by some
other family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It simply means that for
us the key to fulfillment was our beloved <i>Tinkerbelle</i>.</p>
