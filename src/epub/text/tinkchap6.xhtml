		<p class="MsoNormal">A tremor ran through <i>Tinkerbelle</i> as she bumped gently against the dock. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Lying doubled up in her tiny darkened cabin, I felt the tremor and it sent a sympathetic tingle of anticipation coursing down my spine.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I shifted to the most comfortable position I could find in that cramped space and tried to sleep. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was difficult. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was keyed up. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I couldn’t help listening to the mingled sounds of the sea and the land that came through the night air.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Across the small harbor a burst of “quack-quacks” marked the spot where I knew a family of semi-tame ducks was bedded down. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I knew, too that an elderly duck couple spent each night under a cruiser stored on a wooden cradle scarcely a dozen paces from where <i>Tinkerbelle</i> lay, and I waited for their reply. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Finally it came, a single no-nonsense “quack.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And then I heard the singing of distant truck tires rolling fast over concrete, and then the splash of a fish jumping and the slap, slap of the ripples it stirred up striking <i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s hull and then the wail of a police siren (or was it an ambulance?), and then the muffled hum of an outboard motor, the bang of a door slamming shut, the cat-like meow of a sea gull, a woman’s voice far away calling in the darkness, the beep of an auto horn, the crunch, crunch of footsteps on gravel, and then the throbbing rumble of the returning Martha’s Vineyard ferry, which for several minutes, drowned out every other sound.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It was a clear night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Through the open hatch I could see a patch of bright stars. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was a bit on the cool side, too, and I pulled the blanket around me more tightly, trying to seal in my body’s warmth.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">When the wake of the ferry reached <i>Tinkerbelle</i> , it jostled her against the dock. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I could feel another tremor each time her rub rail bumped the pilings. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It seemed as though she were quivering with excitement.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It won’t be long now, old girl, I thought.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Both of us were tugging at our moorings, anxious to be off. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> <i>Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s mooring lines were strong, of three-eighths-inch Dacron; mine were made of invisible stuff, the social conventions, habits, thought patterns and bonds of affection that held me to the life on shore. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But in their own way mine were as strong as hers, maybe stronger.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, in the morning we would cast off the lines, sever our links to the familiar land and begin a new life, an ocean voyage under sail. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Soon after daybreak the voyage would begin, and ages-old <i>élan vital</i> , the wind, expelling us from the comfort of the harbor and the sound beyond, pushing us forth into the vast outer world of the North Atlantic Ocean, bound for England, 3,200 miles away.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I watched a pattern of light reflected from the water as it shimmered and danced on the cabin ceiling, little more than a foot above my face. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It cast a hypnotic spell, and soon I was drifting back mentally to the eternal questions of time and space, cause and effect, questions that had fascinated me since my teens. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Only now, as I lay sprawled in <i>Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s diminutive cabin, on the brink of a long, lonely voyage, they seemed more poignant than ever.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">A great many thoughts sailed through my mind that night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I can’t remember them all exactly, but I do recall the general outlines of some of them.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I remember I nearly had to pinch myself, literally, to make myself realize it was really <i>me</i> in that cabin, ready to begin a voyage that had been a dream of mine since high-school days in India, where I had been born and raised by American missionary parents, the eldest of four children. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It seemed incredible that a dream so old was on the point of actually becoming a deed.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Most of the thoughts that flowed from this wonderment sprang from questions that began with “How” or “Why.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The most basic one of all was: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Why was I there? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That is, why was a middle-aged, married, sober, sedentary and presumably sane copy editor of the <i>Plain Dealer</i> now, on the night of May 31, 1965, lying in the cabin of a 13½ -foot sailboat in the harbor at Falmouth, Massachusetts, intent on departing the next day on a voyage to Falmouth, England? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What interplay of events thoughts, feelings, desires and other causes had brought it about?</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The causes began, I suppose, at Woodstock School in Landour, a town situated 7,000 feet above sea level on the first range of the Himalayan Mountains, about as far as one could be from the ocean and still be in India. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> To an assembly program one Thursday in the early summer of 1935 came a handsome German man of about twenty-six to tell of a voyage he and some friends made from Sweden to the island of Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They had rented a fair-sized sailing vessel for the weekend and then had kept it for the six months or so it took to complete their voyage. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The young German showed movies that included some spectacular shots of mid-ocean storms and skiing on the snow-covered slopes of a Fuego mountain.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I was enthralled by the adventures of the voyage. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Vicariously, I had never enjoyed anything so much in my life, and inevitably, although from afar, I fell in love with sailboats and the ocean. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I became a sort of landlocked Dante pining for a seaborne Beatrice.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It was a love seldom gratified for I wasn’t able to acquire a sailboat of my own until August, 1958, when I bought the craft that became <i>Tinkerbelle</i> , but from that day on I read every book I could find about voyages in small sailboats. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The first one was a William A. Robinson’s tale of sailing around the world in his lovely <span class="SpellE"><i>Svaap</i></span> . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then came Harry <span class="SpellE">Pidgeon’s</span> story of circling the earth in <i>Islander</i> , which he had built himself, Dwight <span class="SpellE">Long’s</span> book about his circumnavigation in <i>Idle Hour</i> and Captain John C. Voss’s report of his venturesome voyage in the converted Canadian Indian dugout .</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">By the time I got to Captain Joshua Slocum’s classic account of his pioneering <span class="SpellE">singlehanded</span> voyage around the world in the <i>Spray</i> , I had made up my mind that if I ever got the chance I, too, would sail around the globe or, at least, make a long voyage in a boat under thirty feet in length. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And so a dream was born.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The dream never died although there was seldom any noticeable evidence that it was still alive. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Whole years went by without my so much as mentioning boats to anyone, as I graduated from Woodstock; attended <span class="SpellE">Lingnan</span> University in Canton, China, for a semester; visited Japan (where one afternoon I did my only pre- <i>Tinkerbelle</i> ocean sailing); earned a degree at Antioch College; served with the 66 <sup>th</sup> Infantry Division in France, Germany and Austria during and after World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>; worked as a reporter on newspapers in Washington Court House, Ohio, and Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania; married the former Virginia Place of Pittsburgh; acquired a daughter and a son and, in 1953, joined the <i>Plain Dealer</i> copy desk.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">During all these events the dream of ocean voyaging remained in the back of my mind like an incubating microbe waiting for the right moment to flare up as a full-blown disease. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Every so often, after reading some particularly gripping tale, I became afflicted with virulent sailboat fever. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Books about adventurous voyages periodically raised my temperature alarmingly, making it an enormous struggle to continue on course through college and into a journalistic career. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But somehow I always managed to get a grip on myself and wrestle the fever back down to normal before it was too late; that is, I managed it every time but the last time, which was why I finally found myself in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">in the harbor at Falmouth, Massachusetts.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The first actual sailing I did was on the Jumna River at Allahabad, India, where my father, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> James C. Manry, taught philosophy at Ewing College and where my</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">brother, two sisters and I spent our winter vacations from school. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That first sailing experience became a landmark in my life. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’ll never forget it.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">A couple of young American instructors at Ewing College had bought an Indian rowboat, a craft about sixteen feet long made of galvanized steel metal stretched over a heavy wooden frame, and had converted it into a sailboat. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They had equipped it with a sheet-iron centerboard, a mast and boom of bamboo, galvanized solid-wire shrouds, and a <span class="SpellE">mains’l</span> and jib of light canvas. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’m sure it was the only boat of its kind anywhere on the Jumna or, for that matter, on the Ganges, either, except possibly at Calcutta on the seacoast.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">My brother and I obtained permission to use this little sloop soon after its completion. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As we bent on the sails, a crowd of Indians gathered on the shore and on a nearby bridge, and every Indian boatman in the area turned our way to see the fun. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I feel certain that very few of these spectators had ever seen a fore-and-aft rigged sailboat, since all the Indian vessels that plied the</span> Jumna and Ganges had square sails that could be used only when the wind blew from astern. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The Indian boats also lacked center boards, which undoubtedly made our craft seem that much stranger to the massing crowd.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">I don’t know what went through John’s head as we prepared to sail, but I do know that I had feelings that must have paralleled those of the Wright brothers as they took to the air at</span> Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and of Edison as he gave the electric light bulb to the world. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were pioneering a great step forward in sailing technique and, by demonstrating it for all the Indians ashore and afloat to see, passing it on to them as a priceless boon. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Now, after centuries of abysmal ignorance, they would at last learn how to sail with the wind abeam; even how to sail upwind by tacking from side to side. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My pleasure and pride at being able to bestow this great blessing on the Indians was only made more intense by the skeptical expressions of some of the watchers who seemed to be saying to themselves,”It’ll never work.” <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We’ll show ‘ <span class="SpellE">em</span> , I thought. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We’ll show ‘ <span class="SpellE">em</span> it works and that we know how to make it work. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It didn’t matter to me that neither John nor I had sailed a boat of any sort before, fore-and-aft rigged or not. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Our only asset was some reading I’d done. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But that was enough for me. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The reputation of all American’s, if not all westerners was at stake.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Despite my cockiness we started out rather timidly. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> John stationed near the mast to handle the jib sheets while I sat in the stern controlling the mainsheet and tiller. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was pure beginners’ luck that we weren’t immediately caught in irons, bow to windward, and blown ashore stern first. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Surprisingly, we got under way with reasonable dispatch and as we picked up speed I could sense a wave of amazement sweeping through the crowd. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> You see, I said to myself, we aren’t being pushed sidewise as you expected; we’re moving ahead just fine, and at a pretty good clip. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And look! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We can even go a little bit into the wind! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> You never saw one of your flat-bottomed barges doing that!</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Everything went well, considering it was our very first attempt at sailing, and as we glided back and forth under the bridge and from one side of the river to the other, we rapidly gained self-assurance. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We discovered that sailing was a delightful, exhilarating sport, and that we were pretty good at it; no, very good at it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Our confidence soared.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">“Let’s put on a real show for ‘ <span class="SpellE">em</span> ,” I said.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We adjusted the sails for maximum draw on a beam reach until the boat, heeling excitingly, knifed through the water at top speed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Wow! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What a frolic! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We knew our audience had never before seen wind power move a boat so fast and the thought made us, or at least me, delirious with the heady pleasure that accompanies unrestrained showing off.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">And then</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">it</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">happened.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The centerboard and rudder caught on a sand bar and spun the boat into a jibe. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The boom lashed around like a giant club.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">I ducked just in time. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> John didn’t.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">My brother took the full force of that flailing boom on the side of his head and it nearly knocked him out double, meaning both unconscious and overboard. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He could easily have been killed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was lucky; only my pride was hurt, although that grievously. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My face turned as red as John’s turned white.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We limped back to the boat landing, disembarked and slunk away. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> To the everlasting</span>
		</p>
		<p align="CENTER">

		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">credit of the dozens of Indians who witnessed our comeuppance, not one made a gloating remark or in any way called attention to our embarrassment. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Every single one was a gentleman. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And I’m still grateful.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">As the wounds to skull and pride healed, we discerned a lesson in our mishap. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was that the Indians’ boats ere perfectly adapted to navigation conditions on the Jumna and Ganges. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Centerboards and fore-and-aft rigs were out of place there. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Traditions and centuries of experience, we admit, should not be scorned or tossed overboard lightly.</span>
		</p>
		<p>After that whack on the head my brother’s main recreational interest turned from boating to mountain climbing. I guess he decided in the quietness of his own mind that it was much better to risk being clobbered by falling rocks at high altitude than by whiplashing booms at water level. It was a good decision, for he has developed into an accomplished mountaineer.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">My own enthusiasm for sailboats and sailing not only survived the catastrophe on the <span class="SpellE">Juman</span> , but increased in the months and years that followed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> However, it is conceivable that if that swishing spar had struck me instead of John I might never have followed the trail that eventually led to</span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and to the</span> Atlantic. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> John might then have taken to the ocean while I scaled lofty peaks in India and western Canada. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Psychologists agree, I think, that bumps on the head (or the lack of them) can have a profound influence on one’s life. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They call it the pleasure-pain principle.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">
 </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">I don’t want to give the impression that my thoughts on that last night of May, 1965, percolated exactly as I have described them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They didn’t. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But I did meditate about why I was in Falmouth Harbor, ready to begin a long risky voyage, and I did reach the conclusion that the chain of events that led to my being there began with the yearning aroused by the German chap who spoke at Woodstock and my reading, and the pleasurable aspects of my <span class="SpellE">Jumna</span> River initiation into sailing.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">In the period between the initiation on the</span> Jumna (it was in 1936) and my purchase of the boat that developed into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in 1958, I went sailing no more than five times. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But that was sufficient to magnify my love of sailing into something resembling a passion, which, in turn, made it inevitable that, as soon as we as a family could afford it, I would buy a sailboat.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Succeeding links in the chain were conversion of the boat into a more seaworthy craft, growing confidence in the boat’s performance and in my ability as a sailor, studies that indicated an Atlantic crossing in the summer was feasible, an increasing determination not to let my long-time vision of an ocean voyage slip by unfulfilled and, finally, the granting by the</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Plain Dealer</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of a leave of absence which, coupled with three weeks of</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">vacation, would give me enough time for the voyage.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">In this way, in the early spring of 1964, my dream came into fortuitous conjunction with the opportunity to make it come true. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That was what I had wanted, what I had longed for <span class="SpellE">for</span> so many years. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was, like my first sail and the day I got married, another great moment in my life. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I recalled some lines by Thoreau: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Now put the foundations under them.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So I began in earnest to put the foundations under my air castle.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">I must make it clear, though, that this was no one-man project; it was a family affair. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Virginia and the children were in on it from the instant of the first firm decision to go. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They helped in innumerable ways, but more than anything else, by just being there and letting me know I had their approval and support. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They knew how long I had dreamed of a voyage and, bless them, they believed in the value of attaining one’s dreams. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wouldn’t have gone otherwise.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The main factor in my personal motivation, naturally, was my love of sailing, especially the type of sailing that goes under the heading of cruising, as distinct from racing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Sailing, for me, has been a way of achieving both companionship with my family in the healthful outdoors and much-needed solitude away from jangling telephones, auto exhaust fumes, too-eager salesmen and other unpleasant details of civilization. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This love, this need, fundamentally, is a feeling in my bones, a pulsating in my viscera so personal it cannot be adequately explained. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (I’m not trying to be mystical or mysterious. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That’s just the way it is.) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Nevertheless, I’ll try my best to account for it.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">As every human does, I have expended a large part of my life searching, often blindly and sometimes painfully, for Truth. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (But maybe searching isn’t the right word because quite often the whole game’s been reversed and Truth has found me, notwithstanding my kicking and screaming and panic-stricken efforts to avoid it.) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The result has been that through</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">the years I have collected a few miscellaneous chips from the Mother Lode; at least, I hope I have. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> These, insofar as human conduct is concerned, include the golden rule, Thomas A. Edison’s axiom “Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits’; Socrates’ adage “The beginning of knowledge is the awareness of ignorance” and Anglican Archbishop Richard <span class="SpellE">Whately’s</span> postulate “A man will never change his mind if he have no mind to change.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But in all my days on this earth I have come across no more than a handful of chips that, assayed for their Truth content, came anywhere near equaling the pure, unvarnished verity of what Water Rat said solemnly to Mole in Kenneth <span class="SpellE">Grahame’s</span> delightful story</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">
 </span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">“Believe me, my young friend,” said Water Rat, “there is nothing-absolutely nothing-half so much worth doing as simply messing about in boats.”</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Of course, I’m being half facetious. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But also half serious. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Water Rat’s statement, to me, comes very close to being the revealed Word, the supreme Truth.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">I find immense pleasure in the gurgle and splash of a boat propelled by a direct force of nature, the snapping of canvas and the humming of rigging in a fresh breeze, the rattle of ropes running through blocks, the crying of gulls, the lift and heave of a buoyant hull, the pressure of wind against my body, the sting of flying spray, the sight of billowing sails and the swirling foam of the wake. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> To me, nothing made by man is more beautiful than a sailboat under way in fine weather, and to be</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">on</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">that sailboat is to be as close to heaven as I expect to get. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It is unalloyed happiness.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">It is sheer delight to whisk myself off on a “small planet,” as Joseph Conrad once described a boat, and, for a few hours or days, escape from the troubles and tensions of life ashore. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Difficulties and stresses fall into perspective while you are sailing, for, in sailing, you are dealing with elemental forces of wind and water that have been here for <span class="SpellE">aeons</span> and are likely</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">to remain long after we mortals are gone; forces that can be gentle and yet, stirred to fury, are so powerful they make all else shrink into insignificance. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Sailing also helps to keep a man aware of his lowly place in the universe, especially if that sailing involves celestial navigation and its concerns with the sun and stars, for there is nothing to equal the astringent effect on one’s ego of a long, thoughtful look into outer space. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There is a challenge, too, in sailing; a summons to learn how to master wind and water and how to master yourself when you are in a crisis, balancing on the edge of panic.</span>

		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">My life on shore, especially in</span> India <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">, conditioned me to enjoy sailing, I think, because a sailor must be somewhat fatalistic, as the Hindus are. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He must be prepared to accept whatever comes, from flat calms to hurricanes; and he must, like the Hindus, train himself to enjoy the conditions he gets if he doesn’t get the conditions he enjoys. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> From the Indians, too, I absorbed the patience that serves a sailor well, and an appreciation of the fact that there is a great deal more to life-and to a voyage-than mere movement from one place to another.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Sailing also has been a handy escape valve for the psychological pressures that tend to build up on the newspaper copy desk where I have labored for the last thirteen years correcting, insofar as I could, the facts, spelling, grammar and style of reporters’ stories, weeding out possible libels and double meanings and writing headlines. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> These pressures go with the job as certainly as paint-spattered hands go with a career in art. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They are a product of recurring press deadlines, sedentary work, occasional friction between divergent personalities and the ever-present consciousness that regardless of how knowledgeable one may be one’s reservoir of information is never entirely adequate; that the only perfect copy-desk man would be one who knew all there was to know about everything. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The pressures may at times build up to considerable intensity, but putting my hand on the tiller of a sailboat releases them as surely and almost as swiftly as touching a grounded wire frees my body of static electricity.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">A fondness for large bodies of water, particularly bodies of salt water, is a last major factor in my love of sailing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The clean, saline tang of sea air is a powerful attraction. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So is the awe inspired by the ocean’s (any ocean’s) enormous breadth and depth, by the ghostly presence of all the famous and infamous ships and men and women it has carried through the centuries, and by the mysteries hidden beneath its sometimes placid, sometimes stormy surface. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Perhaps there is an inherited something in the protoplasm of my body cells that feels an agreeable kinship with the sea, where life on earth began and where it existed for such a long time before it took to the land. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> At any rate, the sound of the sea, especially of breakers pounding on a beach, have a strangely soothing effect that I crave only slightly less than an addict does drugs.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Aside from my love of sailing, I looked forward to a small-boat voyage because of an inexplicable notion I had that a voyage was a kind of microcosm of life, a life within a life, if you will, with a birth (beginning), youth, maturity, old age and death (end), and that it was possible for a sailor to express himself in this miniature life-with his technique, responses to changing conditions and endurance-somewhat as an artist expresses himself with paint and canvas. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It seemed to me, too, that in this abbreviated life a sailor had an opportunity to compensate for the blemishes, failures and disasters of his life ashore.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">This was a curious idea. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Where it came from I don’t know. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It may have arisen from an awareness of behavior I was ashamed of, of unlovely shortcomings in my life ashore, linked with a hope that in the compressed life of a sea cruise I could, perhaps, redeem myself. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I had to concede that my voyage would benefit few persons other than myself, except insofar as it might, momentarily, lift some who heard of it out of the routine of their own lives, but it did give me a segment of existence that, God willing, I might fashion into something nearer to a work of art than my life on land had been. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This idea</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">gratified me strangely although I knew perfectly well that at sea, alone, I would of necessity be an unsocial being.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">So I was there in</span> Falmouth Harbor, ready to begin a transatlantic voyage in a midge sloop, because I loved sailing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I loved the sea, I had long wanted to make an ocean voyage and I had finally got the chance to make one. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Contemplating all this, I decided I knew and understood the “Why” of the voyage, except for two final points: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Why was I making the voyage alone? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And why was I making it in such a small boat?</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Actually, these questions were easily answered. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was sailing in</span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">because she was the boat I happened to have and I was confident she was equal to the task. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And I was sailing alone because I felt</span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was too small to carry the supplies of more than one person. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> If there was anything I was absolutely certain of, it was that I was</span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> there to commit suicide or perform a stunt or set a record or advertise a product. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> No one had given me financial assistance and I wasn’t sponsored by anyone, not even by the</span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Plain Dealer</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, my own newspaper. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Nor was I actuated by the expectation of vast monetary gain, although I did dare to hope that I might, by writing articles or a book, recoup the cost of the voyage and, if I was lucky, make enough more to help my children through college without going deeply into debt. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> All I wanted to do, basically, was to achieve the dream of an ocean voyage I’d been harboring for nearly thirty years by crossing the</span> Atlantic to England, and I wanted to do it with as little fuss as possible.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Most people, I think, understand the urges that prompted me to take the voyage; at least, most of those I’ve spoken with about it, now that it is over, have been satisfied with my brief explanation of why I did it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Occasionally, though, a person will ask me “Why did you do it?” with an inflection that makes the query sound as if the person were asking “Why do you play Russian roulette?” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The crux of it, of course, is the implied dangerousness of a voyage like</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">‘s and the inference that it is a bad policy if not morally wrong, to do anything, ever, that is the least bit dangerous.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">It seems to me there are two sides to the danger coin, two reasons for questions like this. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> One is that the values of comfort and safety are being overemphasized in our society to the detriment of other, perhaps more important, values for which it may be worth enduring a little discomfort, even danger. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The other is that persons who are <span class="SpellE">shorebound</span> , who have had no opportunity to learn about boats and the sea, tend to exaggerate the dangers of a small-boat voyage. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And, of course, for such person to undertake lengthy ocean voyages themselves would in fact, be highly dangerous. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Not so for persons with experience, a levelheaded grasp of the prerequisites and adequate preparation.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Essentially, I believe, it is a question of familiarity, of what one is used to. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The same man who quakes at the idea of sailing across an ocean will, paradoxically, drive a car from coast to coast with hardly a thought about the annual toll of deaths on</span> United States highways. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He doesn’t dwell on the hazards of automobile travel because they are so near, so familiar; he faces them every day. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> If he were equally familiar with the hazards of the sea, I am sure he would accept them with equal equanimity. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I accepted them with a fair degree of composure, not because I am more courageous (or more foolish) than the average person but because I took the trouble to familiarize myself with them and prepare ways of coping with them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I admit that luck played a part in the success of the voyage, but not so big a part as might be imagined. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I feel that intensive and extensive planning reduced this element to an absolute minimum. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I planned with utmost care, first, because I am a husband and father with responsibilities toward those who love me and depend on me, and, second, because I feel it is the height of thoughtlessness to voluntarily get oneself into a predicament necessitating a call for help that may endanger the lives of others.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The moral questions evoked by my voyage cause me grave concern. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Did I have the right to endanger my life, even slightly,</span>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and consequently jeopardize the future of my family? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And did I have the right to separate myself from all human society and, for two or more months, occupy myself solely with doing something I had longed to do for years, but which would be of little value to others; in other words did I have the right to surrender unconditionally to hedonism? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> With much soul-searching I answered these questions in the affirmative, although I am willing to concede I may have been wrong in doing so.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Although I’m convinced the <span class="SpellE">riskiness</span> of the voyage was far less than many people believe, I still must confess it was this <span class="SpellE">riskiness</span> that made the voyage seem adventurous, exciting-a wonderfully far cry from the immobility, tedium and sometimes harrowing predictability of copy-desk existence.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">I remember thinking that night about the uncertainties ahead, about what might be waiting for</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">and me out in the open ocean. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wondered whether this watery world would be kind to us, allowing us to pass unscathed to our far-off goal. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Or would it be cruel, taxing us beyond endurance, cutting our voyage short, perhaps even destroying us? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And the more I thought about it, the more I realized I really didn’t want to know the answers to those questions. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Not in advance; not for certain. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> For it was the uncertainties, the surprises, the risks that added up to the challenge that made life-and a voyage-interesting and worth while. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Without them the sources of hope would dry up and life would indeed wither into a monotonous meander from womb to tomb.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">But because risks add zest to life doesn’t mean that I advocate casual plunges into situations fraught with danger, the more the merrier; or that I believe a voyage can or should be made more zestful through the deliberate courting of peril. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This is foolishness, if not worse. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What I do believe is that a blanket policy of risk avoidance is unsatisfying, that there are risks worth taking, provided you are aware of them and prepared to cope with them.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">The key factor, obviously, is preparation. And, for a voyage, this preparation must be founded on a brutally realistic appraisal of the qualifications of the boat, its equipment and its skipper. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Wishful thinking here can be fatal. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I want to make that unmistakably clear because I stay awake nights worrying that the newspaper’s detailed coverage of my voyage may induce others to attempt similar cruises without proper preparation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I would be greatly saddened if my voyage became the indirect cause of a sea tragedy.</span>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Lying there in</span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">on the eve of departure, I was mindful of the extent of my preparations and it gave me a feeling of assurance. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I didn’t have the sensations of a man about to step off a cliff, as I had expected to have. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My mood was one of calm inner confidence. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And yet, remembering my</span> Jumna introductions to sailing, I was only too aware that confidence is often that quiet faith, that euphoria, that pervades your being just before you fall flat on your face. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So I held my feelings in bounds, well on this side of bravado.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Sleep was a long time coming that night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Being on the verge of a dream cruise was too exciting. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The sounds of the harbor and surrounding area fell too insistently on my ears. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Even though I couldn’t feel it inside the cabin, I knew a gentle breeze had sprung up because the ripples it roused made clicking sounds as they hit the crevices in</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">‘s <span class="SpellE">lapstrake</span> hull. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The air currents also, now and then, made the halyards band against her mast-clack, clack, clack, clack.</span>
		</p>
		<p>I heard a dog bark a couple of times somewhere off the port beam and then the garbled sound of boys’ voices-teenagers’, I guessed-too far off to decipher. But soon the voices drew closer and I could make out a word here and there. It seemed that the boys had been fishing down near the harbor’s mouth and were now, at about midnight, on their way home. I couldn’t decide how many there were; probably no more than three.</p>
		<p>When they came to the spot where <i>Tinkerbelle</i> was tied up, one of the boys said, “Hey! Look at that!”</p>
		<p>Footsteps plunked out on the dock. There was a brief pause, and then <i>Tinkerbelle</i> heeled over as someone stepped onto the cabin top.</p>
		<p>“Whatcha doin’?” one of the youths said.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Just wanna look in her,” the boarder replied.</p>
		<p>I heard him kneel. Then his silhouetted head, upside down, moved into the open hatchway from above. I could feel his eyes trying to pierce the darkness.</p>
		<p>What to do? I was sure he didn’t have the least suspicion</p>
		<p align="CENTER">
			<img alt="Drawing of youth looking into Tinkerbelle at Falmouth, Mass." src="../images/tinkerp72.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<p>that anyone was in the cabin. If I spoke or moved, he might be so startled he’d fall overboard. I didn’t want that. So I froze, and tried not to breathe.</p>
		<p>He was breathing so heavily himself I needn’t have worried about his hearing me. He stayed there for what seemed like a couple of minutes. I wondered if he could make out my face or the outlines of my body under the dark-gray blanket. He gave no indication that he could.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Finally the head withdrew and</span>
			<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i>
			<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">rocked silently when the boy stepped back onto the dock.</span>
		</p>
		<p>“Gee!” he said. “Never saw a boat that small with a cabin on it. You s’pose someone goes cruisin’ in it?”</p>
		<p>“Nah,” came the answer. “It’s much too small.”</p>
		<p>
