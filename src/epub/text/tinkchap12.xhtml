		<p class="MsoNormal">With <i>Tinkerbelle</i> doing her stuff, I bore up well under the waves’ onslaught, but I began to have troubles of another sort, for this time, about 10 A.m., <i>Tinkerbelle</i> time, I had gone without sleep for nearly thirty hours. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As it had done the day I picked up that “hitchhiker,” my mind began to play strange tricks on me.</p>
		<p>During the next hour or so, as closely as I can recall, my being was gradually permeated with the inexplicable feeling that <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I were accompanied by other people in other boats, none of them identified specifically, and that we were there to search for a small dock and community known as Ada’s Landing. I didn’t know why the other sailors had to find the place, but I had a clear understanding of why I had to do so: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">I was to meet Robin and help her overcome some serious trouble she was in. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I didn’t know exactly what her problem was; all I knew was that it was extremely serious and that a solution was essential for her future happiness.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I took in the sea anchor and, sailing under <span class="SpellE">genny</span> alone, began to hunt for the landing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We sailed and sailed and sailed; and now, looking back on it, I realize the sailing I did that day, through those giant waves, must have been remarkable, even fantastic. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Or maybe the magnitude of the waves was itself a part of the hallucination.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Eventually we got to a part of the ocean called the Place of the Sea Mountains, an aptly named spot, for the waves there were as lofty as snow-capped Alpine peaks; so enormous, in fact, that I realized, even in my <span class="SpellE">hallucinational</span> state, that for safety’s sake <i>Tinkerbelle</i> should be returned to her sea anchor.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">So I streamed the bucket again and we resumed our roller-coaster ride, slowly drifting eastward, stern first.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">As we climbed and slid over those aqueous peaks, the notion seeped slowly into my mind that we were in a kingdom of the sea ruled by a crusty old Scotsman named <span class="SpellE">MacGregor</span> , a man with scraggly white sideburns, plaid tam-o’-shanter, knobby knees showing below his kilt and an even more knobby cane in his hand. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And for some unknown reason he was determined to do me in.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, I wasn’t going to let him knock me off if I could avoid it, but he <i>did</i> seem to have a rather unfair advantage in the form of a demonic choir of evil-faced, surplice-clad cutthroats. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This horrendous assemblage of gravel-voiced killers had the miraculous power of controlling the size of the waves by the loudness of their singing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They were singing their lungs out, goaded on to ever-increasing volume by vociferous tongue-lashings administered by <span class="SpellE">MacGregor</span> . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Louder and louder they sang, and bigger and bigger grew the waves. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It seemed as though my hours, maybe my minutes, were numbered.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">During all this (and it went on for several hours) I had strange visions of <span class="SpellE">MacGregor</span> and his choir in the sky that appeared very much like the double exposures one sometimes sees in a movie or on television, where two or more images are super-imposed on the same background. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And as the minutes passed, old <span class="SpellE">MacGregor</span> grew increasingly enraged by his choir’s inability to sing loud enough to put an end to me. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He raved and stormed all over the heavens, threatening his dealers in <i>a-cappella</i> death with horrible punishments if I survived their vocalizing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Meanwhile, I waxed more and more confident that, with <i>Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s help, I would be able to hold my own. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Perhaps I even became over confident because, even the waves had not diminished in size, I felt I had to go on and find Robin. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was sure she was in desperate need of my help.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">So I drew in the drogue again, set the <span class="SpellE">genny</span> and, with that single sail, started to swoosh up and down and around the wave mountains as if I were crossing the Rockies by bobsled. I did some of the fanciest sailing of my life, swishing around the edges of those huge waves, dodging the breaking crests and, sometimes, down their forward slopes at breakneck speed.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">But I never seemed to get anywhere, much less to Ada’s Landing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And neither did the people in the other boats accompanying me. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We all seemed to be trapped in a maze, unable to find the way out. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That’s what the trouble was: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> the Place of</p>
		<p align="CENTER">

		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">the Sea Mountains was a maze-like ocean realm, set entirely apart form the regular ocean we had been on the day before. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We had to get out of it before we could get to Ada’s Landing.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Eventually, after hours of struggling to find our way out, <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I came upon a little elfin character who looked like a cross between a leprechaun and <span class="SpellE">Gunga</span> Din.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“How can we get out of this place?” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I asked him in a tone of intense urgency.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">He stood there on the water studying me for a long time in an impish way that I couldn’t fathom. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then he scratched his bald head, threw out his arms, palms up, in a gesture of sad amazement, and said:</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Sir, the trouble is you have been sailing clockwise. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> If you want to get out of here you must sail counterclockwise.”</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">And with that he was gone.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I put <i>Tinkerbelle</i> about and started moving on a counter-clockwise course. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It seemed to be the correct maneuver, for soon we came to a place where the sea descended in a gigantic staircase leading off to the eastern horizon. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The whole world seemed to be tilted and yet, marvel of marvels, none of the water in the sea ran down the staircase and off the edge of the horizon.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I now did some even fancier sailing than we had done already; we went down that mammoth staircase lickety-split. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What we were actually doing, I guess, was to surf-ride the waves, which, through some sort of perceptual distortion induced by the hallucinations, appeared to be great downward steps in the sea. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The thrills of downhill runs were electrifying, far more stirring than any I’d had before in all my life. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They warned of danger, but I was in no condition to heed them.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">We charged down wave after wave as if we were on a toboggan and then along came a wave we couldn’t handle. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It flung us forward so fast we broached and over we went. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I found myself in the ocean a second time. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wasn’t knocked as far from <i>Tinkerbelle</i> this time, though, because I had kept a firm grip on the tiller. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was back on board in a jiffy.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Two more times that afternoon <i>Tinkerbelle</i> broached and I was knocked into the sea by waves slamming into us from abeam. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I held firmly to some part of the boat each time and got back aboard quickly, but the repetitious way in which I was being dumped overboard was as exasperating as my boat’s self-righting accomplishments were gratifying.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Late in the afternoon we got to the bottom of the wave-formed staircase and again met the <span class="SpellE">Gunga</span> Din pixy. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He told me Ada’s Landing was off to starboard, not much farther, and so I turned and headed in the direction he indicated. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> In a few minutes I began to “see” bits of land ahead that I took to be the landing, but they always disappeared before I got right up to them. It was most perplexing, and equally infuriating.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I came to the conclusion-reluctantly, because he seemed a nice fellow-that <span class="SpellE">Gunga</span> Din was having prankish fun at my expense and that I had better not rely further on anything he said. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’d simply have to do the best I could on my own. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I felt that I was bound to get out of the Place of the Sea Mountains, sooner or later, but I was assailed by painful shafts of doubt about whether I would be able to reach Robin and help her. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The search for Ada’s Landing began to seem futile.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">My misgivings and anguish increased with each passing minute. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My very soul was on the rack, tormented between the desperate ardor of my desire to help my daughter and the accumulating suspicions that I would not be able to do so, that I would fail her at this time when she needed me more than she ever had before. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was agony. <i>
 </i></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">At about sunset <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I (alone now, for our sailing companions had vanished) came to what seemed to be the brow of a long, easy slope off to port; and at the bottom of it was the “regular” ocean. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This was the way out of the Sea Mountains. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We’d found it, at last.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Tinkerbelle</i> , still sailing under <span class="SpellE">genny</span> alone, all but flew down that ocean hill and rushed happily out into the normal, <span class="SpellE">unjinxed</span> , <span class="SpellE">unbewitched</span> sea. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Oh, what a relief it was to be in it again! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The face of our predicament was transformed from a frown to a smile, as though we had moved with one leap from hell to heaven. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Goodbye, <span class="SpellE">MacGregor</span> ! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Goodbye you sinful singers!</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I had a queer feeling that Ada”s Landing was nearby and that maybe we”d find it after all. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But I needed sleep; every cell in my body cried for it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So I decided to rest and go on to the landing in the morning, hoping that Robin would be able to wait that much longer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I put out the bucket drogue, took down the <span class="SpellE">genny</span> , hoisted the anchor light in the rigging, unshipped the rudder, changed into dry clothes (those I had on were still wet from my ) and climbed into the cabin, closing the hatch (all but a crack left open for air) after me. It was good to pull that blanket over me and close my eyes!</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I now had no qualms whatever about sleeping in the cabin. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> In any case, the sea had settled down considerably; it wasn”t making nearly as much fuss as it had during the daylight hours. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Conditions seemed ideal for sleeping, but just before I dropped off, the boat jiggled violently in a way that, I felt, couldn”t possibly have been caused by wave action. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I stilled my breathing and strained my ears for some clue to what was going on outside. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I thought I heard someone, or rather, two people, holding onto the boat and whispering. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And then the boat jiggled again in that peculiar way. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was clear what was happening. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Two jokers had swum out from the landing and were jostling the boat to annoy me, to keep me from getting the sleep I needed and to see how far they could go before I flew into a rage.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I tried to control my temper, but it steadily became more and more difficult. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> When I heard my tormentors pulling themselves around the boat, hand over hand, and, in low voices, planning more trickery, I could hardly contain myself. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then they jiggled <i>Tinkerbelle</i> again.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Cut that out!” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I yelled in as threatening a tone as I could produce.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Quiet reigned for two or three minutes and then I heard more whispering. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Soon the boat began to rock. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Those damnable swimmers were hanging onto the rub rails, one on each side, and seesawing the hull with fiendish delight. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I could stand their impudent maliciousness no longer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Adrenalin gushed into my veins, making me hot with anger, and I stormed out of the cabin ready to beat my harassers to a pulp.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">” <span class="SpellE">Dammit</span> ! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> You bastards are going to get it now!” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I roared.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">But nobody was there.</p>
