<p class=MsoNormal>Sailors have seldom been envied by confirmed landlubbers
and, until recent times, with good reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Their lives were hard and usually short.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Boswell reported in 1759 that Samuel Johnson said:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;No man will be a sailor who has contrivance
enough to get himself into jail; for being in a ship is being in jail with the
chance of being drowned.  A man in a jail has more room, better food, and
commonly better company.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was a
widely held view in those days, I imagine, because the conditions under which
seamen existed were so atrocious that press gangs often had to be employed to
fill out the crews of naval ships; and once a man was pressed into service he
usually did not escape, except through death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About a hundred years later Ralph Waldo Emerson echoed
Johnson&#39;s opinion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Writing of a voyage
he took to England in 1847, he said, &#34;The wonder is always new that any sane man can be a
sailor.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was referring to the
sailor&#39;s &#34;life of risks, incessant abuse and the worst pay,&#34; for conditions at
sea hadn&#39;t improved greatly in a century.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Nowadays, of course, few persons talk this way about life at
sea, either in the merchant marine or in the navy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lot of today&#39;s seafarers is so much
better that it bears scarcely any resemblance to the lot of seamen of Emerson&#39;s
or Johnson&#39;s time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span
class=SpellE>impressment</span>, harsh discipline, bad food, outbreaks of
scurvy and brutalizing environment of the old, old days are gone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet, while life aboard a commercial freighter
or naval battleship is no longer regarded with horror, a rather large segment
of the <span class=SpellE>landbound</span> population (at least in the United States) now looks askance at a </p>



<p class=MsoNormal>new breed of sailors&#45;those
who go down to the sea in small pleasure boats.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>With Emerson, this group wonders how any sane man can do such a thing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The reason for the attitude today is, I suppose, compounded
of a fear of deep water and the widespread thumb&#45;rule judgment that a vessel&#39;s
safeness depends on its size&#45;the bigger the safer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although I hadn&#39;t conducted any private opinion polls, I had
learned enough in the course of everyday living to have a fairly good idea of
the reaction I would get if I let it be known that I planned to sail across the
Atlantic in little <i>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
could plainly see the raised eyebrows and hear the expression of alarm such a
confession would produce among my <i>Plain Dealer</i> associates and Willowick neighbors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wouldn&#39;t have minded if that had been all,
for these things couldn&#39;t have hurt me or my family.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What did worry me, though, was the
possibility that some well&#45;intentioned person who knew nothing about boats or
the ocean, but who had an unreasoning fear of both, would go to work on Virginia and try to convince her that, for my own good, she should refuse to give the
voyage her blessing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m sure Virginia would have withstood such pressures admirably, but at the time they would have
made her life a great deal more difficult, psychologically, than it needed to
be, and I didn&#39;t want that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I engaged in a deception for which I hope the good Lord
and my friends will forgive me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I let
everyone continue thinking I expected to cross the ocean with another man, in
his 25&#45;foot boat, and whenever anyone inquired about our plans I answered as if
a voyage in the large boat were still in prospect.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Actually, almost all the planning I did for
the voyage in <i>Tinkerbelle</i> was the same as it would have been for a
voyage in the bigger craft (except that the provisions were reduced by half),
so the amount of fabricating I had to do was minimal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It consisted mainly of simply allowing a false
impression to remain uncorrected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I started my studying and planning with the determination that if at any time prior to </p>



<p class=MsoNormal>embarkation I encountered a
difficulty of such magnitude as to be what I considered a serious threat to
success, I would decide against attempting the voyage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was resolved not to let foolish pride sweep
me into a bad situation or, being in one, make me continue in it to the bitter
end.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For my family&#39;s sake as well as my
own I refused to be concerned about loss of face, for I considered it far
better to be a live coward than a dead hero.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What I had to do first of all, it seemed to me, was to
determine as precisely as I could the nature and full extent of the hazards to
be expected on a transatlantic voyage, and then, once this was done, come to a
levelheaded decision as to whether or not these hazards were surmountable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If they weren&#39;t, I&#39;d simply have to go back
to being a copy&#45;desk Walter <span class=SpellE>Mitty</span>, at least until
another, more propitious opportunity for oceanic adventure came along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The weather was the first major hazard to be reckoned
with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I knew from reading about other
voyages and from studying the marvelously informative pilot charts of the North
 Atlantic issued by the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office that the
summer months were best, but I lacked more precise information.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wrote to the U.S. Weather Bureau in Washington and the summaries it sent me, while still not so detailed as I had hoped for,
were most encouraging.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They contained
sentences such as these:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;The weather of
June is usually very pleasant over the North Atlantic.  The wind speeds average
force 3 to 4 over most of the ocean. Gales are infrequent.  Weather conditions are
relatively settled during July with buildup of the Azores high.  Wind speeds
average 10 knots or less 40 to 60 percent of the time.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then I ordered, from the Naval Oceanographic Office, an <i>Oceanographic
Atlas of the North Atlantic Ocean</i> and a book entitled <i>Wind Waves at Sea</i>
and these gave me all the information I was looking for, as precisely as was
feasible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I learned that the highest
wave ever reliably reported was a monster a hundred and twelve feet high </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>observed from the U.S.S. <span
class=SpellE><i>Ramapo</i></span> in the North Pacific in February, 1933, and
that the highest waves seen in the North Atlantic were
sixty&#45;footers, also observed in the winter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The <i>Atlas</i> yielded the prediction that on a transatlantic voyage
lasting through June, July and August I would have approximately two days of
waves twelve feet high or higher, about four days of eight&#45;to twelve&#45;foot
waves, about nine days of five&#45; to eight&#45;foot waves, and smaller waves the rest
of the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also forecast roughly
four days with winds of twenty&#45;eight knots or stronger, eighteen days of
seventeen&#45;to twenty&#45;seven&#45;knot winds, nineteen days of eleven&#45; to sixteen&#45;knot
winds and weaker winds on the remaining days, with nine or ten days of calm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Tinkerbelle</i> already had taken six&#45;foot waves and
about thirty&#45;knot winds on Lake Erie without having to heave to and I was
confident that, hove to, she could survive conditions that were far more
severe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I realized, of course, that the
Oceanographic Office statistics were averages that wouldn&#39;t necessarily hold
true for a given summer; there was always a chance one of those infrequent
storms would strike.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Red tracks on the
pilot charts showed that storms had crossed my proposed trans&#45;<span
class=SpellE>atlantic</span> course in the summers of 1952, &#39;54, &#39;55, &#39;56, &#39;59
and &#39;60, so the probability seemed to be much greater than fifty&#45;fifty that I
would take either a head&#45;on or a glancing blow from a storm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Still, I was confident my little boat would
acquit herself well, especially since I planned to make her unsinkable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I won&#39;t say I believed she could live through
a hurricane, but I did believe she could take a terrific amount of punishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many small-boat voyagers have stated in their books that
size has little or no bearing on a boat&#39;s seaworthiness and, visualizing
conditions at sea in a storm, I was inclined to believe they were right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A small boat, first of all, is a great deal
stronger, pound for pound, than a big ship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Secondly, a small boat, being light and buoyant, will recoil before the
waves and tend to ride over them, whereas a big ship will offer immense
resistance.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>The predicament of a big ship in a storm is that of an
almost irresistible force meeting an almost immovable object; something is
likely to give, and fairly often it is the rivets or plates in the big ship&#39;s
hull.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is why big ships are
sometimes battered and broken, even sunk, by storms that do no more than cause
a few hours&#39; inconvenience to properly handled small boats.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So far so good.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
what about the differences between my boat and other sailboats less than, say,
twenty&#45;five feet in length&#63;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Would <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
equal them in ability to weather a storm&#63;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It seemed to me that the Achilles&#39; heel of the usual
ocean&#45;going yacht was its keel, a thick slab of iron or lead that, in some
boats, weighed more than a ton.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
purpose of this weight was to keep the boat sailing right side up, a most
worthy objective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But what if the boat
sprang a bad leak or through some other misfortune filled with water?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would sink to the bottom like a lead
casket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As I saw it, the prime function of a boat was to float, and,
preferably, to go on floating no matter what calamities befell it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For even if its sails were torn, its rudder
lost, its mast broken, even if it capsized or had its planking ruptured, those
aboard it would have a fighting chance to stay alive as long as it continued to
float.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, to insure that <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
would remain afloat (with me and all my supplies and equipment on board), I
filled the spaces between her deck beams with polyethylene&#45;foam flotation
material and, in addition, made five or six thick planks of the material to be
packed inside the hull with my supplies. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Of course, the boat and all my gear had to be
weighed to make certain the total weight didn&#39;t exceed the buoyancy factor of
the flotation material, but when all this was accomplished, I had a vessel that
was virtually unsinkable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that
contributed greatly to my peace of mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I came to the conclusion that the dangers posed by the winds
and the waves had been successfully neutralized; that there was nothing about
them to make me give up my plan.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
meant, to me, that the biggest single obstacle to the voyage had
been hurdled.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Then it occurred to me that next in importance to the
assurance of staying afloat was the assurance of being able to call for help in
case of need, so I bought a surplus Air Force &#34;Victory Girl&#34; distress&#45;signal
transmitter, a neat little waterproof gadget that, on being cranked,
automatically sent out SOS signals on two frequencies.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of these, 500 kilocycles, the marine
distress call frequency, had a range of a little more than a hundred miles; the
other, 8364 kilocycles, the aircraft distress channel, had a range of about
fifteen hundred miles, which was far enough to reach shore from the middle of
the ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Taken together, the guarantee of staying afloat and the
guarantee of being able to summon aid, if necessary, seemed to me to eliminate
or reduce most of the risks of the voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A lot of things could still go wrong, certainly, but the likelihood of
their being fatal was now slight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently,
from this point on, my preparations went full steam ahead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next biggest problem, the danger of being run down by a
big ship while I was asleep, was disposed of much more easily.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would prevent this from happening by,
insofar as possible, staying away from the regular shipping lanes, all of which
were clearly marked on the pilot charts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Where it was impossible to stay clear of these lanes, while crossing
them near New York and at the
entrance to the English Channel, I would stay awake,
with the aid of pills if necessary, until I was safely into the un&#45;traveled sea
beyond.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>O.K.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next problem.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about navigation?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was obvious that simply by sailing east I was bound to fetch up,
sooner or later, somewhere on the western coast of Europe but I hope I could be a little more accurate about my landfall than that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted to sail to England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be mortifying if, instead of landing
there, I landed in France or Spain or Portugal or Ireland.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was essential that I learn the rudiments
of celestial navigation, a subject</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>whose very name filled me with dread, for as a mathematician
I was a great tennis player.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Calculus,
spherical geometry and related areas of mental torture were distinctly not my
forte.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was the sort of guy who, in
college, had had to take high&#45;school algebra.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But as it turned out navigation wasn&#39;t the bugaboo I had
thought it was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some wonderful,
anonymous men had taken all the pain out of it by producing a book of
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>logarithmic tables called H.O. 214, which reduced all the required calculations
to simple addition and subtraction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And add
and subtract I could, just.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So, armed with George W. <span class=SpellE>Mixter&#39;s</span> <i>Primer
of Navigation, </i>Carl D. Lane and John Montgomery&#39;s <i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Navigation the Easy Way, H.O. 214</i>, the <i>Nautical
Almanac</i>, charts on which I could pinpoint the position of our home and a
surplus Air Force sextant, I set out to teach myself how to guide a boat from
one port to another across the trackless, <span class=SpellE>roadless</span>, <span
class=SpellE>signpostless</span> sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And I did it on our home&#39;s front porch.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>My sextant could be used either with the natural horizon or with an artificial bubble horizon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In my practice sessions I used the bubble,
and the check I had on the accuracy of my calculations was the known latitude
and longitude of our house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If my sun
lines came close to this position, I knew my sextant sights and figuring were
reasonably accurate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They didn&#39;t come
close at the beginning, though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I
remember correctly, my first sight put me somewhere in the middle of Hudson Bay, Canada,
hundreds of miles to the north.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was
a mite alarming.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I couldn&#39;t do better
than that, I might as well throw away the sextant and rely on a <span
class=SpellE>Ouija</span> board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I
improved in time, happily.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the end my
position lines usually came within nine or ten miles of being right on the nose
and, from my reading, I gathered that that was pretty good going with a bubble
sextant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, it remained to be seen whether I could do as well
from a cockpit of a little boat on the bounding main, but I had the feeling I
could.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I decided another difficulty
had been overcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next I bought a short&#45;wave radio with which to get the time
signals that were essential for navigation and to maintain some sort of
contact, through news programs, with what was happening in the world ashore
while I was alone at sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also hoped
musical and entertainment programs would help me while away some of the hours
I&#39;d have to spend at the tiller.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had an idea sharks wouldn&#39;t bother <i>Tinkerbelle</i> or
me, as long as I stayed out of the water (and I planned, in any case, to take
along chemical shark repellant), but I was a little concerned about what whales
might do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I knew of several lone voyages
whose boats had been damaged by whales and also two instances of real&#45;life Moby
Dicks having sent large whaling vessels to the bottom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In November, 1820, the Nantucket whaler <i>Essex</i> was attacked by a whale in the Pacific and sunk, thus
providing a model for the climax of Melville&#39;s novel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And in August, 1851, while the novel was at
the printer&#39;s, the <i>Ann Alexander </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>of New Bedford was done in by a whale, also in
the</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Pacific.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t
enjoy contemplating what might happen if an enraged whale were to assault my
miniature sloop and yet I couldn&#39;t decide what I might do to guard against such
a catastrophe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The best plan I could
devise was to blast away on the compressed&#45;gas foghorn I expected to carry with
me and to put my faith in the theory that an animal won&#39;t bother you if you
don&#39;t bother it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One danger at a time, I tried to think of every conceivable
misfortune that could beset us and to contrive a way of taking the sting out of
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if lightning struck?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I put a lightning rod at <i>Tinkerbelle&#39;s</i>
masthead and grounded it through the shrouds to a hefty copper plate on her
bottom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if a wave washed me
overboard?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I rigged a lifeline to
prevent my being separated from the boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if the rudder broke or was somehow lost?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I built a spare rudder and, in addition,
bought spare gudgeons and <span class=SpellE>pintles</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the hull was damaged or the mast
broken?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I assembled a complete tool kit
and a supply of lumber of various types and sizes with which to make
repairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the boat capsized?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I bought an inflatable life raft and figured
out a way of using it, with a line running from it to the sunken masthead, to
right the boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about my
health?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a complete medical checkup
(in fact, I had two) and passed without any ifs or buts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if my water supply was spoiled or
lost?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I bought a solar still for
converting sea water into fresh water.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if my food supply didn&#39;t last?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I acquired an extensive fishing outfit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if my SOS transmitter failed?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I collected flares, signaling mirrors and dye markers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if something forced me to abandon <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
and take to the life raft, how would I stay alive?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I studied survival techniques perfected by
the Navy and put together a complete survival kit, including emergency food and
water.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if I was becalmed in the
path of a ship?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I took along a radar
reflector to make my presence known to ships equipped with radar and also took
along oars with which to row out of the way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(I decided against taking our little 1.7-horsepower outboard motor,</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>or any other outboard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I couldn&#39;t have carried enough fuel to make it worth while.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What if the sails were badly torn?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got together a sail repair kit and spare
sails; in fact, I bought a red nylon <span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span> to make
the boat as highly visible as I could.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if a shroud parted, the stem plate gave way or something else
broke?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I bought replacements for every
piece of equipment that was under strain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What if I became ill or suffered a serious injury?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I put together a complete kit of medical
supplies, including antibiotics, disinfectants and pain killers, with the help
of a Cleveland physician and
pharmacist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What about appendicitis?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I knew that this malady had almost brought William A. Robinson to grief
while he was cruising among Galapagos Islands off the
coast of Ecuador and I certainly didn&#39;t want to go through the same ordeal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, I felt the chance that my appendix
would act up was so remote that I didn&#39;t need to have it taken out in
advance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it did act up. I hoped to be
able to keep the infection under control with antibiotics until I reached help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so it went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the summer of 1964, before the planning had gone very
far, Douglas, then ten, and I took a cruise on Lake
 Erie that was the longest voyage yet for <i>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We sailed in easy stages from Cleveland&#39;s
Wildwood Park to Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada (seven miles west of Buffalo, New
York) covering more than two hundred miles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This was a trial voyage for me, in preparation for the assault on the Atlantic,
and it made me more confident than ever of <i>Tinkerbelle&#39;s</i>
capability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a thunderstorm one day
she ran up against stiff, squally winds and the biggest waves she had yet
encountered, white-crested rollers six to eight feet high.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The spirited way in which she rode the waves
made me more optimistic than ever about the Atlantic venture, especially when I
remembered having read somewhere that Howard Blackburn of Gloucester,
Massachusetts, a former Grand Banks fisherman who had lost the fingers of both
hands </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>through frostbite and yet had twice taken small boats across the Atlantic, believed
the sailing he had once experienced on Lake Erie was
more dangerous than anything he had met on the ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I began in January, 1965, to gather food supplies from
widely separated sources:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>dehydrated
meat bars from Chicago; components
of Army C rations from Council Bluffs, Iowa,
St. James, Minnesota,
and Dawson, Georgia;
canned white bread and fruitcakes from Nashville,
 Tennessee, and cereal bars, dehydrated eggs
and a number of other items from Newton, Massachusetts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most of the food was purchased at
neighborhood grocery stores, however, and all of it was acquired with an eye to
easy preparation of meals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t want
to spend much time cooking, so practically all the food was precooked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It needed only to be warmed, or, if I was
hard pressed, it could be eaten cold.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
had a little canned-heat stove in gimbals, a frying pan, a saucepan and a
knife, fork and spoon with which to prepare and eat my victuals.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, naturally, I had a can opener; in fact,
several of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few weeks later, when I broke the news of my proposed
voyage to my mother, one of her great fears was that I would forget to take a can
opener and would find myself out on the ocean with plenty of food, but with no
way of breaking into the cans to get at it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She was relieved to hear I was taking precautions to avoid this
catastrophe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Acting on the principle that it is unwise to put all one&#39;s
eggs into one basket, I decided to carry twenty-eight gallons of water divided
among forty half-gallon plastic bottles, three one-gallon plastic bottles and
one five-gallon plastic container.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By
doing this I hoped to prevent any mass loss or spoilage and to facilitate
keeping track of my water consumption.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And, by refilling emptied bottles with sea water, I hoped to maintain
most of the boat&#39;s inside ballast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>According to the usual allowance of half a gallon a day I had enough
water to last fifty-six days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However
this was supplemented by numerous cans of fruit juice and carbonated drinks,
plus a supply of canned water in </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>my survival kit, so I felt it was adequate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Besides, I knew from experience that my
consumption of water would be far less than half a gallon a day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And if I did run short, I could use the solar
still to make more, or catch rain water in a sail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I expected the voyage to take about sixty days, but guessed
that it might possibly take as long as seventy-five days so, to be on the safe
side, collected enough provisions to last a minimum of ninety days.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other west-to-east crossings of the Atlantic had taken between twenty-two and a hundred and twenty-three days, which
indicated to me that my estimate of the trip&#39;s duration was reasonably
realistic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One point about my food supply worried me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How would I protect all those cans from the
corrosive sea water?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contents of any
cans that rusted through would spoil very quickly so that, if worst came to
worst, I might be reduced to living on fish and plankton, a prospect that
didn&#39;t appeal to me in the least.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some
earlier voyagers had protected their cans of food by noting the contents on
each one with paint or indelible ink, removing the labels and then varnishing
the cans thoroughly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This method, I
felt, had now been made obsolete by the introduction of plastic materials; so I
packed my food supplies into heavy plastic bags sealed shut with a hot iron,
two bags containing the food required for one day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each week&#39;s supply of food was then packaged
in a larger plastic bag, which, in turn, was put into a protective canvas
bag.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had eight of these large bags of
food, enough for two months at sea, with enough additional food in the form of
emergency rations to last more than another month.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As all these preparations neared completion,
I began to feel confident that, no matter what my other misfortunes might be, I
would at least have plenty to eat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My provisions included two canned plum puddings Virginia had got me, with hard sauce to go with them, and my plan was to eat one of
these when I reached the halfway point of the voyage and the other when I
reached England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These little celebrations,</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>I thought, would give me something special to look forward
to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As spring arrived, my preparations moved ahead more
quickly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted extra insurance
coverage during the voyage so that if by some unlucky stroke of fate I lost my
life Virginia and the children
would be protected.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted to be sure
of funds for the children&#39;s education and Virginia&#39;s
future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In applying for this insurance I, naturally, revealed my
real intention of sailing in <i>Tinkerbelle</i>, and I was distressed to find
that Lloyd&#39;s, which reputedly stood ready to insure anything, wouldn&#39;t insure
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That gave me a bad jolt, for it made
me feel I wouldn&#39;t secure coverage anywhere.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But then two other companies, apparently impressed by my knowledge of
previous voyages, extensive preparations and the emphasis I put on safety
factors, decided to risk rather large sums of money on me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each of them insured me for twenty-five
thousand dollars at a premium of two hundred and fifty dollars; so, in effect,
they were betting a hundred to one that I&#39;d make it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That encouraged me greatly, for it meant that
if I was lost at sea Virginia would receive fifty thousand dollars over and
above the insurance we already had and it also meant that a couple of
hardheaded business organizations had enough faith in me to regard my voyage as
something more than a harebrained stunt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By this time my close relatives had been told of my planned
expedition in <i>Tinkerbelle</i> (all of them being sworn to secrecy) and, on
the whole, they took the news calmly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
father and father-in-law were no longer living, but, had they been, I believe
they would have given me their blessing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Virginia&#39;s mother accepted
the project with good grace, and my own mother wrote, &#34;Of course, your letter
made me catch my breath; I am sure you can understand.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I can understand the urge within you to
do this thing, and this will be your adventure of a lifetime!&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later I learned that her greatest fear was
that the loneliness of the ocean would drive me insane, a possibility that, I
confess, hadn&#39;t even occurred to me.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>One of my sisters, Dorothy Dole, also was concerned about
the loneliness, but believed I would be able to endure it without ill
effects.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a letter to my mother, my
other sister, Louise, said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;At first I
couldn&#39;t take it [the planned voyage] in, it seemed incredible, and then I
became very excited about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can&#39;t
say that I really understand it; it&#39;s something I think we&#39;d all like to do in
the abstract, but when it gets to actuality, most of us draw back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The main thing I feel is that it is wonderful
to see someone carry out his dream&#45;so few of us get or take the chance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Robert is a dreamer.&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m not sure the characterization dreamer was
meant entirely as a compliment, but I was pleased to hear that Louise believed in
the pursuit of dreams.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My brother, John, and Virginia&#39;s
brother, John, also gave their full support, each of them having yearned at one
point in their lives to take a voyage such as I was planning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They offered many good ideas for making the
trip safer and more comfortable and even assisted in more tangible ways.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One bought me some excellent waterproof bags
in which to store books and film, and the other presented me with a wondrous
little contrivance&#45;a hand warmer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My colleagues on the <i>Plain Dealer</i>, still believing I was
going with someone else in a boat nearly twice the length and several times the
weight of <i>Tinkerbelle</i>, offered all their good wishes as well as
innumerable helpful or humorous suggestions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>During our supper hour from nine-fifteen to ten-fifteen every night we
frequently gathered in the paper&#39;s cafeteria and discussed the voyage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember one night someone brought up the
possibility of our meeting icebergs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
then someone else, recalling the <i>Titanic </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>disaster, suggested that we&#39;d better take
along a phonograph and a recording of &#34;Nearer My God to Thee&#34; to play if the
occasion arose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You at least ought to write down the words of the hymn,&#34;
said Ted Mellow, the <span class=SpellE><i>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span> news editor, &#34;so you&#39;ll
be able to sing it as you go down.&#34;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Ted also secretly solicited contributions from my companions
on the copy desk and used the money to buy a bottle of brandy to be taken on
the voyage &#34;strictly for medicinal purposes.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The bottle was presented to me in a ceremony that left me all choked
up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was deeply moved, partly because I
thought Robert <span class=SpellE>Havel</span>, chief of the copy desk, had
called us together to chastise us for lousy headlines we&#39;d been writing or for
some other dereliction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was indeed a
pleasant surprise to receive liquor instead of a licking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You&#39;ll need that stuff in case of snake bite,&#34; said Robert
Murphy, one of my fellow rim men.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Yea,&#34; chimed in John Metcalfe, my neighbor on the rim.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;But don&#39;t do like the doctors and drink all
the medicine yourself.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The bottle had been prepared to render valuable service in a
moment of crisis, as an auxiliary communications device.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Directions affixed to it said, &#34;In case of
emergency:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>1.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Remove contents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Insert message.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>3.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Launch.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was thoughtful of my friends to be so concerned about communications.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On another occasion Walter <span class=SpellE>Berkov</span>,
an assistant news editor, and I were talking about the voyage and I happened to
mention that I&#39;d cross the Rubicon (that is, make a firm decision about going)
in April.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You mean you&#39;ll cross the Styx,
don&#39;t you?&#34; said Walt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;No,&#34; I replied, with what I imagined was exactly the right
inflection for a debonair adventurer to use, &#34;I won&#39;t do that until June or
July at sea.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not long after this, at about 12:45
 A.M. when our night&#39;s work was done, I happened to walk out to the <i>P.D.</i>
parking lot with Chet Downing and Charlie <span class=SpellE>Mulcahy</span>,
two more of my copy-desk friends, as we set off for our respective homes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;All ready for your voyage this summer?&#34; Charlie asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Just about.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I&#39;ve got to admire your fortitude,&#34; Chet said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Yes, I do, too,&#34; Charlie agreed, adding, &#34;I wouldn&#39;t do what you&#39;re doing for a million </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>dollars.  I&#39;m afraid of water.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why, I&#39;m even scared to look down in the
shower!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I enjoyed the remark hugely and later, on the ocean, I
occasionally conjured up a picture of Charlie standing in the shower, terrified,
and it always made me chuckle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In April, as I&#39;d said I would, I crossed the Rubicon with a
firm &#34;On we go,&#34; and then, in what seemed to be scarcely enough time to turn
around, it was May 1<sup>st</sup> and I was up to my neck in last-minute
preparations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had already gathered all
the necessary charts, pilot books, light lists and so on, but I still had to
get a passport and a smallpox vaccination, fill out a voyage plan and check-off
list and have a signed disclaimer statement notarized for the Coast Guard, fit
a bilge pump to <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and do a number of other chores.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every minute away from my job was spent
attending to these details.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The plan was for my mother to come from her home in Warner, New
  Hampshire, on Saturday, May 15<sup>th</sup>, to be
with us for a week before my departure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She would remain to care for Robin and Douglas, whose vacations from
school were still two weeks away, while Virginia and I and Virginia&#39;s brother
set out on Sunday, May 23<sup>rd</sup> (the day my leave of absence from the <i>Plain
Dealer</i> began), to drive with <i>Tinkerbelle</i> to Falmouth,
Massachusetts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After two or three days
of exploring about Cape Cod and launching and loading the boat, John and
Virginia were to return with the boat&#39;s trailer to <span class=SpellE>Willowick</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Before setting sail I wanted to be sure Virginia reached home safely through the heavy pre-Memorial Day highway traffic.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, on June 1<sup>st</sup>, <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
and I would begin our transatlantic adventure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My mother arrived on schedule on May 15<sup>th</sup>, at the
beginning of what I&#39;m sure was one of the most hectic weeks of her life; but
she endured it with good cheer and before we knew what had happened we began
what was to be my last day of <span class=SpellE>newspapering</span> for some
time to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That morning, in anticipation of the coming weeks at sea, I had the local barber </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>give me a close-cropped butch
haircut.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hadn&#39;t worn my hair in that
style since my Army days and the reaction to it was mixed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia didn&#39;t like it because, she said, it reminded her of the haircut a condemned
man receives before he is strapped into the electric chair.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And John Hilton, an Englishman who had joined
the <i>Plain Dealer </i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>copy desk six or
eight months before, didn&#39;t like it either (Englishmen being partial to longish
hair).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;They&#39;ll never let you into England with that haircut,&#34; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gerry Lee, sitting across the copy desk from me, didn&#39;t
particularly mind the haircut, but, molding his features into an expression of
grave concern, he made the sign of the cross as he said, &#34;Old man, you look as
if you&#39;ve already got a touch of scurvy.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the supper-hour break, when the copy-desk crew
adjourned to the cafeteria, there was a lot of kidding about my having my last
supper; and, with a knowing nod in my direction, William Evans, a police-beat
reporter, remarked, &#34;Some people will do anything to get out of writing
headlines.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Copy editors, of course, are irrepressible punsters and many
puns were exchanged that night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ve
forgotten most of them, but I do recall that someone asked why they have knots
on the ocean and, before I could reply, someone else broke in with &#34;Because if
there were no knots, they couldn&#39;t have the ocean &#39;tide.&#39;&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later on, when we returned from supper and were hard at work
again, Russell Bacon, the desk&#39;s acknowledged master punster, quietly slipped
me a note that injected a pun into a friendly bon-voyage message.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It said, &#34;May the Atlantic surfeit your
greatest hopes.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bacon, now retired, was
one of the kindest men I&#39;ve known.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
addition to doing many other favors, he introduced me to a lotion that, during
the voyage saved my hands from the worst effects of prolonged contact with salt
water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>La Rue Daniels, the <span class=SpellE><i>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span> expert
on dogs and horses, presented me with a lucky </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>twenty-five-cent piece to take with me, and
my good friend Metcalfe, whom I have already mentioned, gave me the snappiest
yachting cap I have ever seen, as well as what he described in a typewritten
note as &#34;a guaranteed instant panic stopper,&#34; an item I might need desperately
in the days ahead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On being unwrapped,
this extraordinary contrivance, dangling from a string, turned out to be a
battered, worn, decidedly </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>secondhand bathtub plug.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It served its purpose well; and so did the
twenty-five-cent piece.When quitting time rolled around, I was deeply touched by
the sincerity with which my colleagues shook my hand and wished me a pleasant
voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It made a lump rise in my throat
to have these men with whom I had worked for so long, through torrents of
written words, express genuine concern for my welfare.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some were so overcome with emotion they
couldn&#39;t speak, and a few, I think, were convinced they would never see me
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt uncomfortable about being
the cause of such intense concern and yet how much more concern there would
have been if they had known I was about to set sail in a 13 ½ -foot boat rather
than a 25-footer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I went to bed that night, on the eve of departure for Falmouth,
I felt that I&#39;d probably done the right thing after all to keep the true nature
of my voyage a secret.</p>
