<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Toward evening on August 9<sup>th</sup>
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and I were alone again on
the ocean, the trawler <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i>, the
R.A.F. <span class=SpellE>Shackletons</span> and the smaller civilian plane
(which, I found out later, had brought out Bill Ashbolt and Eddie Worth) having
departed to return to their bases.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
wind died to a mere whisper, making it difficult to maintain steerageway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We rolled about in the swells for two or three
hours before another breeze sprang up, this one from the south, enabling us to
roll along right on course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We kept
going in fine style until about 3 A.M. when we hove to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had to have sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The next day (Tuesday, August 10<sup>th</sup>)
I awoke at 7 A.M. (G.M.T.) and we
resumed our pace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The noon sight put us at 50° 19&#39; N.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the last two days we had moved steadily
northward toward Ireland,
which meant we were in the clutches of another current.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Sailing Directions</i>, it was probably <span class=SpellE>Rennell&#39;s</span>
Current, which flows at one to one and a half knots northward across the
western approach and entrance to the English Channel.  Our bumping into it indicated, at least, that
we were getting close to the channel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We struggled all afternoon and
part of the night to get back down below 50° N, but a sextant shot at Polaris
during the night put us even farther north, at 50° 25&#39;.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>On Wednesday, August 11<sup>th</sup>,
clouds covered the sky, making it impossible to shoot the sun, so I couldn&#39;t be
sure where we were, exactly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I just had
to do the best I could with dead reckoning and hope the sun would come out
again before we got into deep trouble.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p197">Page 197</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>That night, when I was putting
out the sea anchor and taking down the sails, I lost the <span
class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span> halyard up the mast.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fortunately the end of the halyard didn&#39;t run
through the masthead sheave; the shackle that serves to attach the halyard to
the head of the sail was too big to go through it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But how to get it down again, that was the
problem.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I had to get it down or I
wouldn&#39;t be able to raise the sail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It was too dark then to see what
I was doing, so I decided to wait until morning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a hard time getting to sleep because of
worrying about how to go about retrieving the halyard end.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I knew I couldn&#39;t climb up the mast since my
weight would certainly capsize the boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I wasn&#39;t panicky, for I knew that if worst came to worst I could
unfasten the forestay and lower the mast in its tabernacle, which would make it
simple to recover the halyard and shackle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But lowering the mast at sea would be a tricky operation and I didn&#39;t
want to do it unless it was unavoidable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I hoped there was another way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>After some cogitation in the
morning (August 12<sup>th</sup>) I decided the topping lift might be it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This consisted of a light <span class=SpellE>dacron</span>
line that ran through a small block at the masthead and had both its ends
attached to the end of the boom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With
wire and a pair of pliers I improvised a little grappling hook, lashed it to
the topping-lift line and ran it aloft.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It took about thirty minutes of
flipping the line about to accomplish it, but finally I snagged the shackle
with the grappling hook and, much to my relief, was able to pull the halyard
end back down, shackle it to the head of the <span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span>
and then, joy of joys, hoist the sail.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
were ready to get cracking again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
a great pleasure to have escaped so easily from what might have been a rather
sloppy situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We had to spend part of the
morning riding to the sea anchor because the wind blew too hard for us to sail
safely, but even so, sometime during the day we crossed the meridian of 10° W,
completing the last full stride in the oceanic countdown to Falmouth,
England.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were less than five
degrees of longitude left to cover.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
should reach our harbor haven (and possibly it would seem like
heaven, too) in less than a week, maybe in as little as five days.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voyage was advance in age now; it was
old, full of &#34;years.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The end, with its
mingled joys and sorrows, was near.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p198">Page 198</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It was still quite cloudy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At midday,
however, the sun came out long enough for me to get a good latitude shot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It showed we were farther north than ever, at
50° 33&#39; N, and that meant we were within sixty-five miles of the coast of Ireland.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Something had to be done or we&#39;d make an
unintentional landfall on Cape Clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The trouble was that besides the
current we had a southeast wind to fight, and that meant tacking.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that, in turn, meant slower progress; and
I wasn&#39;t in the mood for dawdling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did
everything I could think of to propitiate <span class=SpellE>Aeolus</span> and
induce him to shift the breeze around to the south or southwest, but nothing
worked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It came down to making a choice
between tacking and landing in Ireland.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I chose tacking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I had nothing whatever against Ireland or the Irish; it was just that I had started out to sail to England and my family and newspaper colleagues were waiting for me there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the only decent course of action was to do
my level best to get there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We went over
on the port tack, heading southwestward on a course of 220°.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This took us southward against the current
all right, but it also took us <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>away</i>
from England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was only on the starboard tacks, if the
wind held in the southeast, that we&#39;d be able to head <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>toward</i> England.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Early in the afternoon, while
still on the port tack, I heard a plane to the south; in fact, I continued
hearing it for half an hour or more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
thought that probably it was the R.A.F. back, trying to find me, and later I
learned the R.A.F. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>been out looking for me and that its failure
to find me had aroused considerable concern on shore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(I hoped Virginia wasn&#39;t worried.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had told her that
small-boat voyagers were reported lost rather frequently, erroneously, and not
to be unduly alarmed if I was so reported.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I had feared, it was widely reported that I was lost, but of course I
wasn&#39;t.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was simply that nobody knew
where I was except me.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p199">Page 199</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>About the time the sun dipped
below the western horizon, the wind moved into the southwest, enabling <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle </i>to sail southeastward on a broad
reach.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were on the home stretch,
sprinting for the finish line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>The breeze was so good I decided
to keep going all night and sometime after midnight we passed down the aisle between two long rows of trawlers, so brilliantly
lighted they gave the ocean a festive look.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We seemed to be rolling along the surface of a mammoth liquid birthday
cake between two ranks of flickering candles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The experience put me into a happy, <span class=SpellE>partyish</span>
frame of mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>When daylight returned, I
suddenly realized it was Friday the thirteenth and I wrote in the log:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;I hope this isn&#39;t an unlucky day.&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>All that day and the following
night we continued sailing southeastward, battling the <span class=SpellE>Rennell</span>
Current, working our way to a lower latitude so that we could pass to the south
of the <span class=SpellE>Scilly</span> Isles and into the English
 Channel.  I believed that
would be much safer than trying to go to the north of the <span class=SpellE>Scillys</span>
because along the northern route lay dangers of the Seven Stones, a mile-long
group of exposed rocks, and Wolf Rock, a lighthouse-topped hazard some eight
miles southwest of Land&#39;s End.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>We continued moving southeastward
throughout the next day (Saturday, August 14<sup>th</sup>) and through about
half the night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shortly before midnight we approached a particularly brightly
lit trawler and I thought I had better go up and check our position.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we drew near, I saw what seemed to my
unsophisticated eyes to be some sort of pagan rite, perhaps a ritual of
initiation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Persons clad in yellow
oilskins (and I&#39;m almost positive some of them were women) were kneeling on the
deck and then rising and kneeling again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then they would disappear into the hold for a while, only to reappear
and go through the whole rigmarole again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I simply couldn&#39;t understand what it was all
about.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p200">Page 200</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I hated to disturb whatever was
taking place, but I hated even more to go without a check on our position.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So when we got to within ten or fifteen yards
of the trawler I yelled with all my might, &#34;Which way to Bishop Rock?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>It was a silly question:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ll admit that freely because I knew the way
perfectly well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Bishop Rock was a
navigation hazard near the southwestern edge of the <span class=SpellE>Scilly</span>
Isles and on it stood Bishop Rock Light, a hundred-and-sixty-seven-foot-high
granite lighthouse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was used as a
point of departure or arrival by most of the ships entering or leaving the English Channel, and it was about forty-five miles away on a heading of 20°
from where we were at the moment.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So,
O.K., it was a silly question, but surely it was good enough to serve as the
opening gambit in a conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But do
you think I got a reply, or so much as an acknowledgment that I had been
heard?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No, sir!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those yellow-coated figures kept right on
with their ritual without so much as blinking an eye.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;Ahoy!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hey, there!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I yelled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;Can you tell an alien
where to go to register?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Still no reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>I pulled myself together, filled
my lungs and let go with a torrent of sound of sufficient volume to rattle <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s sails:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;<span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

class=SpellE>Sie</span> Deutsch? <span class=SpellE>Parlez-vous</span> <span
class=SpellE>fran&#231;ais</span>?</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How&#39;s
the fishing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Catching any sea monsters?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>Nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one on the deck of the trawler, if that&#39;s
what it was, even looked in my direction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Everyone just kept on kneeling, rising, kneeling, rising and
disappearing into the hold for a time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was queer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the
strangest thing I&#39;d ever seen in my life, and I had seen some pretty strange
things in my time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I still don&#39;t
have the faintest idea what it was all about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>By then <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> was past the ship and moving out of voice range and,
anyway, it was obvious that no one was going to pay any attention to us, so we
kept on going.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a lot of </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p201">Page 201</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>fun mulling the whole thing over
in my mind, though, and I wondered what sort of headline I would have written
if a story about the experience had come over the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>P.D.</i> copy desk while I was working there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Probably I would have written something like:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>SAIL SLIPS;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>GOES SILLY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>AT SCILLYS</p>

<p class=MsoNormal></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A couple of hours later, at about 1 A.M., I put out the bucket and got some rest even
though we were very close to the shipping lanes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I reasoned that the dangers arising from
exhaustion were greater than the danger of being run down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was so tired that I had no trouble at all
falling asleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Knockout drops couldn&#39;t
have accomplished it any faster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the morning (Sunday, August 15<sup>th</sup>) I woke up
just in time to see a trawler (it looked exactly like the one of the strange
ritual) moving off, apparently after having examined <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> at close range.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I popped out of the cabin and shouted after it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The response was the same:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>zero.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Listening to the B.B.C. during breakfast, I heard that Virginia was aboard a trawler searching for me; in fact, she had been out on the sea for
several days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wished that I had some
way to let her know where I was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How I
looked forward to seeing her again!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No
more solo voyages for me; that was for sure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Any future sailboat trips would be in a larger boat and with Virginia
and the children.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The noon sun shot showed we were down to about 49° 40&#39;N,
about twelve miles south of the latitude of Bishop Rock Light, so it was safe
to turn eastward, or even a little north of due east, to head into the channel
toward the famous Lizard Head that I had heard so much about in the accounts of
other voyages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Lizard, as it was
called, was now about sixty miles away and Falmouth,
our journey&#39;s end, was only twelve miles beyond that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would all be over in a couple of days,
three at the most.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p202">Page 202</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a nice day, mostly sunny, with only a few small
clouds in the sky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the afternoon
I saw lots of ships and at one point experienced another, brief
hallucination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was a trawler
behind us and I imagined that Virginia was on it, trying to reach us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and I had been caught in a
whirling maelstrom and were in danger of being sucked under.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The water was very confused and rough and, as
I looked astern, I hoped and prayed that Virginia&#39;s
trawler wouldn&#39;t be caught, as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and I were, and dispatched into the depths.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I even went so far as to yell at the trawler, &#34;Stay out!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Stay out!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It&#39;s too dangerous here!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(I&#39;m
sure if they had been able to hear me they would have thought I had blown my
top.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The trawler skirted the terrible area where we were and
finally went out of sight over the horizon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That seemed to snap me back to reality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We kept on moving all afternoon on a course of about 75°.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sea seemed to be crowded with ships.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were lots of freighters and trawlers
and once I even saw a big passenger liner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the evening I had dinner and afterward, about the time the sun
dropped out of sight, resumed sailing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were some clouds close to the horizon in the northwest and others
scattered about to the south, all tinged with red from the afterglow of the
sunset.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, all of a sudden, I saw a
light flashing (seemingly from the clouds) in the northwest, off <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s port quarter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It went:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Flash, interval, flash, long interval, flash, interval, flash, long
interval, flash, interval, flash, long interval.  Could it be true?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i>
it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>With trembling hands I got out my light list and turned to
the proper place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the column on
&#34;Characteristic and Power&#34; were listed these facts:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;<span class=SpellE>Gp</span>. Fl. W. (2);
period 15s; fl. 0.7s, ec. 1.6s; fl. 0.7s, <span
class=SpellE>ec</span>. 12.0s; Cp. 720,000.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Translated into normal English this meant:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Group, flashing, white (2 flashes); duration
of total cycle, 15 seconds; first flash, 0.7 second; eclipse, 1.6 seconds;
second flash, 0.7 second; eclipse, 12 seconds; candlepower, 720,000.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p203">Page 203</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>I timed the flashes and the intervals of darkness between
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There could be no doubt now; it
was Bishop Rock Light.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And it was
exactly where it should have been, according to my navigation!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was the most amazing thing of all.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I hadn&#39;t been afraid of falling overboard,
I would have jumped up and danced all around <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s little deck!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was great to see something, at last, that I knew was on land, even
though I couldn&#39;t see the land itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In high spirits I sailed on through the night on a course
for the Lizard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a wonderful brisk
sail in the moonlight, but as the first hints of dawn appeared in the east I
grew so drowsy I periodically fell asleep at the tiller and, several times,
almost put <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> into a
jibe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I decided I simply had to stop for
some rest, so I hove to under sail, without the sea anchor, and dropped into
unconsciousness in the cabin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next thing I knew, I heard voices shouting, &#34;<span
class=SpellE>Matey</span>, wake up, wake up!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Yank, are you there?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mr. Manry,
wake up!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I jumped out of the cabin and
saw an English trawler with four or five men at the rail calling out between
cupped hands.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p204">Page 204</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was surprised that they knew my name, but glad they had
awakened me, for I knew I shouldn&#39;t be sleeping in those heavily traveled waters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And then, as I drew alongside I got another, bigger shock; they asked
for my autograph!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They must be daft, I
thought.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why in the world would they, or
anyone, want <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>my</i> autograph.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I obliged, happily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It turned out that the skipper of the trawler, the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Trewarvenneth</i></span>,
was a fine-looking Cornishman named Harry Small, and he was the brother-in-law
of Captain Hunter of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>,
the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Trewarvenneth</i>&#39;s</span>
sister ship, which, by sheer coincidence, was scouring the ocean for me with
Virginia aboard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Captain Small soon had
Captain Hunter on the radio telephone, told him he had found me and gave him
our position.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Captain Hunter replied
that he was already headed for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and would arrive in about four hours.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was delighted to know that in just that length of time I would see my lovely
wife again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I thanked the captain and crew of the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Trewarvenneth</i></span>, which then went on
about its own business, and pushed on for the Lizard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Soon things really began to pop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>An R.A.F. <span class=SpellE>Shackleton</span> flew over and
dropped another canister, this one with a message saying, &#34;Sorry we have not
been with you since Monday.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You have
done well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Position now; 49° 32&#39; N, 06°
05&#39; W.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mrs. Manry aboard trawler
PZ513.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Will home her to you now.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cmdr. R. A. Carson, Royal Air Force.&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The big plane started circling about, sending
out that signal for the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then a handsome Royal Navy frigate, H.M.S. <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brereton</i>, hove into sight and, after it
got close enough, its captain and two sailors came over to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> in an inflated rubber boat powered with an outboard
motor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had a wonderfully pleasant
little visit as we moved along side by side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The captain, Lieutenant Commander Nick Barker, gave me a bottle of fresh
milk, the first I&#39;d had in more than two and a half months.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ll never forget how delicious it was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also gave me a sailor&#39;s hat ribbon with
H.M.S. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brereton</i> printed on it in
letters of gold, as well as the pleasure and honor of signing my name in the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Brereton</i>&#39;s guest book.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then he putt-putted back to his own</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p205">Page 205</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>ship, which also was emitting a homing signal for the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> and which began circling
around <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> like a mother hen
watching over a chick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Wonderful welcome,&#34; I had written in the guest book, and it
certainly was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was so marvelous, so
totally different from what I had expected, that it took on a sort of Alice in Wonderland quality, an out-of-this-<span class=SpellE>worldness</span> that
left me numb.</p>

<p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Virginia&#39;s
diary for the previous seven days tells vividly her side of the story.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tuesday, August 10</i>&#45;Poor
Robert, the winds are practically gale force, and we heard tonight on TV that
he had been swept overboard several times.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Luckily, he has a lifeline around his waist.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He must be exhausted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do wish we could do something to help him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Bill Jorgensen hired a trawler and went out and interviewed
him. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Everyone in Cleveland knew it, but we didn&#39;t.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our boys are
kind of put out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told them if they
ever go to look for Robert to take me along, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wednesday, August 11</i>&#45;We
have chartered a trawler and Russ and Bill and Eric Piper, and Paul Hughes, a <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Daily Mirror</i> reporter, and I are going
to look for Robert.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s all very hush,
hush.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have to be up at 5 A.M.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thursday, August 12</i>&#45;We
left the hotel at 6:30 and raced in
Paul Hughes&#39; car to <span class=SpellE>Newlyn</span> &#91;near Penzance&#93;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I&#39;ll never get used to English driving.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It&#39;s terrifying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Paul says all it
takes is &#39;a bit of dash and verve.&#39;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Our trawler is the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>,
and this is my first time on the sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It&#39;s a lovely day and I&#39;m enjoying it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The captain is Ernie Hunter and the crewmen are Jock
Skinner, Bob <span class=SpellE>Sowden</span> and Bert Morris.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bert is also the cook, and he gives us meals
fit for any first-class hotel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He&#39;s
really a whiz in the galley.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don&#39;t
know how he does it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;They all treat me like visiting royalty.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jock told me about Scotland and Bob drew me a sketch of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p206">Page 206</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Friday, August 13 to
Sunday, August 15</i>&#45;Our trawler trip was more like a pleasure cruise than
anything else.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes I felt guilty
for enjoying the cruise so much when poor Robert was alone in his little
cockleshell in the vast ocean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did
acquire a sense of oneness with him, though, which was impossible to feel
ashore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We searched the horizon so diligently I began to see red
sails everywhere I looked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Looking out
over the waves I could understand how it would be nearly impossible to find him
without <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s red sail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Paul and I had a tendency toward seasickness and we took
all our meals at the stern of the boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Luckily, as long as I stayed out of the galley I was able to keep my
meals down.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bert told me to keep on eating,
no matter whether I lost a meal or not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The seasick pills made me groggy, so I did a lot of sleeping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Paul, probably because of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>his</i> pills, was always flopping down somewhere to sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One time he curled up in one of the fish nets
and went to sleep, and Bob sewed him up in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> has
a terrific roll to it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It rolls so far
over the sea comes in through the scuppers on one side and gets halfway across
the deck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, when it rolls to the
other side, the sea goes back out on the first side and in on the other side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The boys are in constant touch with land by radio.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And now and then Russ and Bill communicate
with the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i> by radio and
transatlantic cable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The fellows back at
the newspaper can&#39;t seem to understand why he can&#39;t find Robert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We passed several trawlers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of them we took to be French and among us we figured out enough
French to ask if they had seen &#39;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>un petit
bateau avec rouge</i> sail.&#39; They stared at us in bewilderment and then gave us
that peculiar sign, chopping the palm of one hand with the side of the
other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It turned out they were Dutch!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;No sign or word of Robert and we have had to put back to <span
class=SpellE>Newlyn</span> for more supplies and fuel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still feel he&#39;s all right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monday, August 16</i>&#45;I
couldn&#39;t get to sleep last night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p207">Page 207</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>bed wasn&#39;t rocking and it was too quiet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Guess I missed the sea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyhow, we got up early and made off to <span
class=SpellE>Newlyn</span> once again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This time, hopefully, we&#39;ll find Robert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;It was a sparkling, bright blue day and it felt good to
have a deck under our feet again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
were all filled with high hopes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Bert gave us some old bread, which we crumbled and tossed
to the scores of gulls following us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
couldn&#39;t help remembering the last time I had thrown bread to the sea gulls was
when Robert was loading his supplies aboard <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
in Falmouth, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Russ and I had a conversation about my feelings concerning
Robert&#39;s safety.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told him I felt that
when Robert left Falmouth, Massachusetts,
he became one of the sea creatures and, since God watches over them, I felt
sure He had Robert in His care, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Maybe it was childish, but I felt I just had to have faith.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And what is life itself but many acts of
faith?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have believed from the
beginning that worry would avail me nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It couldn&#39;t possibly help Robert and it could drive me mad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#39;While we were talking Bert came out and said, &#39;The Captain
wants you in the wheelhouse.&#39;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I ran along the deck and climbed the little ladder into the
wheelhouse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Captain Hunter said he just
heard by radio that his brother-in-law, the commander of another trawler, had
found the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> a few miles
southeast of the <span class=SpellE>Scilly</span> Isles.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robert had been curled up in the cabin,
asleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;From that moment on a carnival air prevailed aboard the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> with dancing on the deck and
slapping of backs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Soon an RAF plane
flew over so close we all ducked and Captain Hunter, who had piloted a boat to
help evacuate the British forces trapped at Dunkirk during World War II, thought for a moment that he was back there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Bert fixed us some sandwiches because there wouldn&#39;t be
time for a proper meal, and we were too excited to eat anyhow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>
moved at top speed to meet Robert and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p208">Page 208</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I remember Eric came up to me, took my chin in his hand and
said, &#34;Are you happy, <span class=SpellE>luv</span>?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I felt tears of joy springing into my eyes as I answered,
&#39;Oh, yes,&#39; and said a little prayer of thanks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Dolphins, that had previously kept their distance, then
began ducking underneath the trawler and diving from one side of it to the
other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, as suddenly as they had
appeared, they vanished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Russ, up on the observation deck, shouted for us to come up
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We all climbed up the ladder and
saw what had become of the dolphins.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were two on each side of the bow, escorting us to Robert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What better sign of luck did we need?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Captain Hunter kept scanning the horizon with his eagle
eyes (no binoculars for him) and finally announced that he had spotted <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don&#39;t know about the others, but as for me,
even using binoculars, it was a good long time before I made out that little
red dot that was <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s
mainsail.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;But what a moment that was!&#34;</p>

<p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In three hours the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>
was in sight and in less than another hour it was alongside and I got my first
glimpse of Virginia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She looked great; tanned and fit, as though
life at sea were agreeing with her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
she had on slacks and a pretty blue jacket and hat that seemed just right.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don&#39;t remember what I said first or what
she said.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everything was so exciting and
happening so fast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mind reeled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I&#39;m sure I must have said it was good to see her and, no
doubt, she said she was happy to see me, but I can&#39;t remember.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was too dazed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must also have said &#34;hellos&#34; to Bill and
Russ of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>, and Paul Hughes and
Eric Piper of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Daily Mirror</i>, to
whom I was quickly introduced, and to Captain Hunter and his good crew.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were like a happy family having a
wonderful time at a picnic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Well, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
got you to England after all,&#34; I called over to Virginia.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p209">Page 209</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Yes,&#34; she said.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;Even
got me here before you.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;When <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
was securely moored beside the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>,
Virginia jumped down beside me
and we hugged and kissed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
marvelous to have her in my arms again, to be together.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The photographers kept asking us to kiss and
hug some more so they could get pictures and, of course, we didn&#39;t mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We could have gone on for hours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia said she liked the looks of my mustache and didn&#39;t mind the tickling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was glad to hear that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was also delighted with my slimmed-down
looks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(We discovered later that I had
lost forty pounds.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We sat down in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s
little cockpit with our arms around each other, but there was hardly any
opportunity for a private conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The two photographers kept asking us to pose and the two reporters kept
firing questions at us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of us were
spinning like tops in a scene of wild, happy confusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I found out later that Bill had told the Englishmen on the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>, &#34;<span class=SpellE>Wait&#39;ll</span>
you hear his laugh.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I guess they
weren&#39;t disappointed, for I did considerable laughing and with as much gusto as
ever.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seems to me that moments of
happiness are times for laughing, and I have seldom if ever been happier than I
was at that reunion with Virginia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the apprehension I had felt over Russ&#39;s
being the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> promotion director
disappeared, for I learned that there would be no brazen attempt to capitalize
on my voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I deeply appreciated the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span>
forbearance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That made everything
absolutely perfect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe old Dr. <span
class=SpellE>Pangloss</span> was right after all; maybe this <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i> the best of all possible worlds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Bert, the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Excellent</i>&#39;s</span> chef, handed me a nice big mug of oxtail soup,
but I was kept so busy answering questions I only had time to take a few sips
of it before someone shouted, &#34;We <span class=SpellE>gotta</span> get going,&#34;
and there was a mad scramble on the trawler to get Virginia back on board and return to <span class=SpellE>Newlyn</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia,
it seemed, had become the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i>
teams &#34;secret weapon.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By getting
exclusive stories and pictures of her high-seas reunion with me the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> men hoped to ease the pain of the</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p210">Page 210</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Atlantic scoop&#34; perpetrated by Jorgensen and
Glendenning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, at the first sign of an
approaching boatload of rival newsmen, they whisked the soup out of my hands
and leaped to pull Virginia up
onto the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had to start moving, anyway, to get the
story filed in time for the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span> deadline.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, getting Virginia back up on the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> wasn&#39;t
nearly so simple as it had been to get her down onto the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>; but Bill and Russ were willing to try.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They grabbed Virginia&#39;s</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>arms and pulled, thinking she would be able to help by
getting a toe hold on the side of the ship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But there was no place for a toe hold; the hull was too smooth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So there she dangled suspended two or three
feet above the water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Virginia said
later she had visions of having to hang there all the way back to <span
class=SpellE>Newlyn</span>, if Russ&#39;s and Bill&#39;s arms held out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Frankly, I didn&#39;t have that much confidence
in their arms.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought she&#39;d drop into
the water any second.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And there I was,
unable to help because <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
had drifted too far away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Suddenly Paul Hughes thought of a way to avert catastrophe
and rushed forward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He reached down to
grab my darling wife</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p211">Page 211</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>by what he later referred to as her &#34;haunches,&#34; but then at
the last second, he saw the horrified look on my face and decided he&#39;d better
not go through with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He explained
afterward that he wasn&#39;t going to offend, knowingly, a man who had just sailed
the Atlantic <span class=SpellE>singlehanded</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The situation was becoming truly desperate when Bert, one of
the crew (good old Bert, Virginia called him after that), lunged low enough to
grab her ankles, raised them, and then rolled her inboard over the railing like
a sack of flour.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Luckily neither of the
photographers recorded the humiliating event.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no time to observe the amenities.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We all waved quickly and then the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> sped away, <span class=SpellE>Newlyn</span>
bound, just as the first boatload of rival newsmen arrived.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This new batch of reporters shouted over
questions and I shouted back answers for thirty minutes or so as <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> continued on toward the
Lizard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the boat headed back to
harbor, to be replaced by another boatful of curious interviewers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It went on like that until darkness began to
fall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were five or six boats
altogether, I think, and believe me, some of those English journalists were
go-getters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Carl Dyer, a reporter for
United Press International, wasn&#39;t satisfied with shouting back and forth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He stripped to his shorts, put on a pair of water
wings and swam over to get a better look at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And there was another chap&#45;I
didn&#39;t get his name, I&#39;m sorry to say&#45;who tried to row over in his boat&#39;s
dinghy but got dumped into the sea instead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally it was night and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and I were alone together once more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was our last night alone together; our last night on the sea.</p>
