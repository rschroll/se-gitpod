		<p class="MsoNormal">Even with shortened canvas <i>Tinkerbelle</i> rushed headlong through the darkness at about seven knots, her top speed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Her spray soaked sails strained against their fastenings as the relentless wind probed for some point of weakness that could be forced to give way. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Every now and then a foaming wave cap slammed into her starboard side, sending up a geyser of spume and sloshing rivers of salt water back along her deck, half filling her self-bailing cockpit. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Under each blow of the waves she lurched like a wounded doe, dipping to leeward with a tense, stomach-churning heave. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> She told me through her tiller, by the way she wanted to point closer to the wind, that she was unhappy. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But I forced her to go on, full tilt.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">What time was it? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> How many more grueling hours to dawn?</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I wrapped the mainsheet once around the tiller and held both in my left hand. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then, struggling to keep <i>Tinkerbelle</i> on course with this hand, I shined a flashlight into the cabin with my right hand and peered through the tiny porthole in the drop panel of the battened-down hatch. I’d hung a wristwatch inside where it was relatively dry. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> From the Greenwich mean time indicated by the watch, I calculated it was roughly 2 A.m. at our meridian of longitude; 2 A.m. <i>Tinkerbelle</i> time. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Oh, God. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Another two and a half hours to sunrise! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’d be frozen stiff by then. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Not to mention blown silly or drowned.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">My teeth chattered even though I had on four layers of clothing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wore padded thermal long johns next to my skin, regular cotton underwear over these, then a woolen shirt and woolen trousers and, on top of everything, a yellow rubberized anti-exposure suit. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And still I shivered.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">My socks, canvas shoes, feet and the lower halves of my trousers and legs were soaked despite the waterproof outer suit. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Rivulets from my sodden hair trickled across my face and down my neck, stabbing icily at my back, making me wince. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My hands were puckered and swollen from prolonged saturation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They hurt, especially the tips of the fingers and thumbs, which made untying knots and adjusting the sheets painful tasks. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Salt-water sores on my buttocks turned the necessity of sitting into pure misery.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The cabin barometer was an enigma. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wasn’t sure what its strange behavior presaged. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> During the day it had fallen gradually. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then, between sunset and about 11 P.m., it had held steady. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But since eleven it had zipped upward again at an alarming rate. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I suspected it meant we’d soon encounter even stronger winds than those we were already battling.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The wind, whistling out of the south at twenty-five knots, the most that <i>Tinkerbelle</i> could stand up to under reefed main, built up menacing seas that threatened to bowl her over on her beam ends. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> She had to be swerved around periodically to meet the biggest of the cross-waves almost head-on or she’d have got into serious trouble.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Yet we kept moving, despite our vulnerability, because I wanted to make up for the seven or eight hours we’d spent hove to in a hard blow during the day. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It would take forever to reach England if we had to spend that many hours out of every twenty-four lying to a sea anchor. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were already several days behind schedule. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So on we raced, taxing our endurance to the limit, reeling off a fraction less than two nautical miles every fifteen minutes.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Except for glimpses at ocean, sails and sky, I kept my eyes fastened on the orange glow of the compass, shifting the tiller to right and left as required to keep the index line opposite the mark for 105°, our eastward course, printed on the swaying card. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We bucketed along, our position at that hour being approximately 40° 43’ N and 60° 50’ W, which meant we were some two hundred and ninety nautical miles south of Canada’s Cape Breton Island and four hundred and eighty miles east of Long Island.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It was Monday, June 14 <sup>th</sup> , and we were fourteen days out from Falmouth, Massachusetts, on the first leg of a transatlantic voyage I had dreamed of most of my life and carefully planned for more than a year.</p>
		<p>“England, here we come!” I yelled at the stars.</p>
