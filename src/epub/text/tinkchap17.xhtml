		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Toward evening on August 9 <sup>th</sup> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> and I were alone again on the ocean, the trawler <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roseland</i> , the R.A.F. <span class="SpellE">Shackletons</span> and the smaller civilian plane (which, I found out later, had brought out Bill Ashbolt and Eddie Worth) having departed to return to their bases. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The wind died to a mere whisper, making it difficult to maintain steerageway. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We rolled about in the swells for two or three hours before another breeze sprang up, this one from the south, enabling us to roll along right on course. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We kept going in fine style until about 3 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> when we hove to. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I had to have sleep.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The next day (Tuesday, August 10 <sup>th</sup> ) I awoke at 7 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> (G.M.T.) and we resumed our pace. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The noon sight put us at 50° 19’ N. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> For the last two days we had moved steadily northward toward Ireland, which meant we were in the clutches of another current. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> According to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sailing Directions</i> , it was probably <span class="SpellE">Rennell’s</span> Current, which flows at one to one and a half knots northward across the western approach and entrance to the English Channel. Our bumping into it indicated, at least, that we were getting close to the channel.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We struggled all afternoon and part of the night to get back down below 50° N, but a sextant shot at Polaris during the night put us even farther north, at 50° 25’.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On Wednesday, August 11 <sup>th</sup> , clouds covered the sky, making it impossible to shoot the sun, so I couldn’t be sure where we were, exactly. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I just had to do the best I could with dead reckoning and hope the sun would come out again before we got into deep trouble.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">That night, when I was putting out the sea anchor and taking down the sails, I lost the <span class="SpellE">mains’l</span> halyard up the mast. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Fortunately the end of the halyard didn’t run through the masthead sheave; the shackle that serves to attach the halyard to the head of the sail was too big to go through it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But how to get it down again, that was the problem. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And I had to get it down or I wouldn’t be able to raise the sail.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It was too dark then to see what I was doing, so I decided to wait until morning. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I had a hard time getting to sleep because of worrying about how to go about retrieving the halyard end. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I knew I couldn’t climb up the mast since my weight would certainly capsize the boat. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wasn’t panicky, for I knew that if worst came to worst I could unfasten the forestay and lower the mast in its tabernacle, which would make it simple to recover the halyard and shackle. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But lowering the mast at sea would be a tricky operation and I didn’t want to do it unless it was unavoidable. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I hoped there was another way.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">After some cogitation in the morning (August 12 <sup>th</sup> ) I decided the topping lift might be it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This consisted of a light <span class="SpellE">dacron</span> line that ran through a small block at the masthead and had both its ends attached to the end of the boom. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> With wire and a pair of pliers I improvised a little grappling hook, lashed it to the topping-lift line and ran it aloft.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It took about thirty minutes of flipping the line about to accomplish it, but finally I snagged the shackle with the grappling hook and, much to my relief, was able to pull the halyard end back down, shackle it to the head of the <span class="SpellE">mains’l</span> and then, joy of joys, hoist the sail. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were ready to get cracking again. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was a great pleasure to have escaped so easily from what might have been a rather sloppy situation.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We had to spend part of the morning riding to the sea anchor because the wind blew too hard for us to sail safely, but even so, sometime during the day we crossed the meridian of 10° W, completing the last full stride in the oceanic countdown to Falmouth, England. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There were less than five degrees of longitude left to cover. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We should reach our harbor haven (and possibly it would seem like heaven, too) in less than a week, maybe in as little as five days. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The voyage was advance in age now; it was old, full of “years.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The end, with its mingled joys and sorrows, was near.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It was still quite cloudy. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> At midday, however, the sun came out long enough for me to get a good latitude shot. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It showed we were farther north than ever, at 50° 33’ N, and that meant we were within sixty-five miles of the coast of Ireland. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Something had to be done or we’d make an unintentional landfall on Cape Clear.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The trouble was that besides the current we had a southeast wind to fight, and that meant tacking. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And that, in turn, meant slower progress; and I wasn’t in the mood for dawdling. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I did everything I could think of to propitiate <span class="SpellE">Aeolus</span> and induce him to shift the breeze around to the south or southwest, but nothing worked. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It came down to making a choice between tacking and landing in Ireland. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I chose tacking.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I had nothing whatever against Ireland or the Irish; it was just that I had started out to sail to England and my family and newspaper colleagues were waiting for me there. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So the only decent course of action was to do my level best to get there. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We went over on the port tack, heading southwestward on a course of 220°. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This took us southward against the current all right, but it also took us <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">away</i> from England. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was only on the starboard tacks, if the wind held in the southeast, that we’d be able to head <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">toward</i> England.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Early in the afternoon, while still on the port tack, I heard a plane to the south; in fact, I continued hearing it for half an hour or more. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I thought that probably it was the R.A.F. back, trying to find me, and later I learned the R.A.F. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">had</i> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> been out looking for me and that its failure to find me had aroused considerable concern on shore. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (I hoped Virginia wasn’t worried. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I had told her that small-boat voyagers were reported lost rather frequently, erroneously, and not to be unduly alarmed if I was so reported.) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As I had feared, it was widely reported that I was lost, but of course I wasn’t. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was simply that nobody knew where I was except me.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">About the time the sun dipped below the western horizon, the wind moved into the southwest, enabling <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> to sail southeastward on a broad reach. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were on the home stretch, sprinting for the finish line.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The breeze was so good I decided to keep going all night and sometime after midnight we passed down the aisle between two long rows of trawlers, so brilliantly lighted they gave the ocean a festive look. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We seemed to be rolling along the surface of a mammoth liquid birthday cake between two ranks of flickering candles. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The experience put me into a happy, <span class="SpellE">partyish</span> frame of mind.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">When daylight returned, I suddenly realized it was Friday the thirteenth and I wrote in the log: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> “I hope this isn’t an unlucky day.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It wasn’t.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">All that day and the following night we continued sailing southeastward, battling the <span class="SpellE">Rennell</span> Current, working our way to a lower latitude so that we could pass to the south of the <span class="SpellE">Scilly</span> Isles and into the English Channel. I believed that would be much safer than trying to go to the north of the <span class="SpellE">Scillys</span> because along the northern route lay dangers of the Seven Stones, a mile-long group of exposed rocks, and Wolf Rock, a lighthouse-topped hazard some eight miles southwest of Land’s End.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">We continued moving southeastward throughout the next day (Saturday, August 14 <sup>th</sup> ) and through about half the night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Shortly before midnight we approached a particularly brightly lit trawler and I thought I had better go up and check our position. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As we drew near, I saw what seemed to my unsophisticated eyes to be some sort of pagan rite, perhaps a ritual of initiation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Persons clad in yellow oilskins (and I’m almost positive some of them were women) were kneeling on the deck and then rising and kneeling again. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then they would disappear into the hold for a while, only to reappear and go through the whole rigmarole again. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I simply couldn’t understand what it was all about.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I hated to disturb whatever was taking place, but I hated even more to go without a check on our position. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So when we got to within ten or fifteen yards of the trawler I yelled with all my might, “Which way to Bishop Rock?”</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">It was a silly question: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’ll admit that freely because I knew the way perfectly well. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (Bishop Rock was a navigation hazard near the southwestern edge of the <span class="SpellE">Scilly</span> Isles and on it stood Bishop Rock Light, a hundred-and-sixty-seven-foot-high granite lighthouse. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was used as a point of departure or arrival by most of the ships entering or leaving the English Channel, and it was about forty-five miles away on a heading of 20° from where we were at the moment.) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So, OK, it was a silly question, but surely it was good enough to serve as the opening gambit in a conversation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But do you think I got a reply, or so much as an acknowledgment that I had been heard? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> No, sir! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Those yellow-coated figures kept right on with their ritual without so much as blinking an eye.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">“Ahoy! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Hey, there!” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I yelled. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> “Can you tell an alien where to go to register?”</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Still no reply.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">I pulled myself together, filled my lungs and let go with a torrent of sound of sufficient volume to rattle <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s sails: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> ” <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Sprechen</i></span> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span class="SpellE">Sie</span> Deutsch? <span class="SpellE">Parlez-vous</span> <span class="SpellE">français</span> ?</i> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> How’s the fishing? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Catching any sea monsters?”</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Nothing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> No one on the deck of the trawler, if that’s what it was, even looked in my direction. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Everyone just kept on kneeling, rising, kneeling, rising and disappearing into the hold for a time. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was queer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was the strangest thing I’d ever seen in my life, and I had seen some pretty strange things in my time. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And I still don’t have the faintest idea what it was all about.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">By then <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> was past the ship and moving out of voice range and, anyway, it was obvious that no one was going to pay any attention to us, so we kept on going. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I had a lot of fun mulling the whole thing over in my mind, though, and I wondered what sort of headline I would have written if a story about the experience had come over the copy desk while I was working there. Probably I would have written something like:</p>
		<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">SAIL SLIPS;</p>
		<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">GOES SILLY</p>
		<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:center">AT SCILLYS</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">
</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">A couple of hours later, at about 1 <abbr>a.m.</abbr>, I put out the bucket and got some rest even though we were very close to the shipping lanes. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I reasoned that the dangers arising from exhaustion were greater than the danger of being run down. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was so tired that I had no trouble at all falling asleep. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Knockout drops couldn’t have accomplished it any faster.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">In the morning (Sunday, August 15 <sup>th</sup> ) I woke up just in time to see a trawler (it looked exactly like the one of the strange ritual) moving off, apparently after having examined <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> at close range. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I popped out of the cabin and shouted after it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The response was the same: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> zero.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Listening to the B.B.C. during breakfast, I heard that Virginia was aboard a trawler searching for me; in fact, she had been out on the sea for several days. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wished that I had some way to let her know where I was. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> How I looked forward to seeing her again! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> No more solo voyages for me; that was for sure. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Any future sailboat trips would be in a larger boat and with Virginia and the children.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The noon sun shot showed we were down to about 49° 40’N, about twelve miles south of the latitude of Bishop Rock Light, so it was safe to turn eastward, or even a little north of due east, to head into the channel toward the famous Lizard Head that I had heard so much about in the accounts of other voyages. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The Lizard, as it was called, was now about sixty miles away and Falmouth, our journey’s end, was only twelve miles beyond that. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It would all be over in a couple of days, three at the most.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It was a nice day, mostly sunny, with only a few small clouds in the sky. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> During the afternoon I saw lots of ships and at one point experienced another, brief hallucination. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There was a trawler behind us and I imagined that Virginia was on it, trying to reach us. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> and I had been caught in a whirling maelstrom and were in danger of being sucked under. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The water was very confused and rough and, as I looked astern, I hoped and prayed that Virginia’s trawler wouldn’t be caught, as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> and I were, and dispatched into the depths. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I even went so far as to yell at the trawler, “Stay out! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Stay out! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It’s too dangerous here!” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (I’m sure if they had been able to hear me they would have thought I had blown my top.)</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The trawler skirted the terrible area where we were and finally went out of sight over the horizon. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That seemed to snap me back to reality.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">We kept on moving all afternoon on a course of about 75°. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The sea seemed to be crowded with ships. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There were lots of freighters and trawlers and once I even saw a big passenger liner. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> In the evening I had dinner and afterward, about the time the sun dropped out of sight, resumed sailing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There were some clouds close to the horizon in the northwest and others scattered about to the south, all tinged with red from the afterglow of the sunset. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then, all of a sudden, I saw a light flashing (seemingly from the clouds) in the northwest, off <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s port quarter. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It went: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Flash, interval, flash, long interval, flash, interval, flash, long interval, flash, interval, flash, long interval. Could it be true? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Was that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">really</i> it?</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">With trembling hands I got out my light list and turned to the proper place. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> In the column on “Characteristic and Power” were listed these facts: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> ” <span class="SpellE">Gp</span> . Fl. W. (2); period 15s; fl. 0.7s, ec. 1.6s; fl. 0.7s, <span class="SpellE">ec</span> . 12.0s; Cp. 720,000.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Translated into normal English this meant: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Group, flashing, white (2 flashes); duration of total cycle, 15 seconds; first flash, 0.7 second; eclipse, 1.6 seconds; second flash, 0.7 second; eclipse, 12 seconds; candlepower, 720,000.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I timed the flashes and the intervals of darkness between them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There could be no doubt now; it was Bishop Rock Light. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And it was exactly where it should have been, according to my navigation! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That was the most amazing thing of all. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> If I hadn’t been afraid of falling overboard, I would have jumped up and danced all around <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s little deck! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was great to see something, at last, that I knew was on land, even though I couldn’t see the land itself.</p>
		<p align="CENTER">
			<img alt="Drawing of trawler with Manry family aboard." src="../images/tinkerp203.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">In high spirits I sailed on through the night on a course for the Lizard. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was a wonderful brisk sail in the moonlight, but as the first hints of dawn appeared in the east I grew so drowsy I periodically fell asleep at the tiller and, several times, almost put <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> into a jibe. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I decided I simply had to stop for some rest, so I hove to under sail, without the sea anchor, and dropped into unconsciousness in the cabin.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The next thing I knew, I heard voices shouting, ” <span class="SpellE">Matey</span> , wake up, wake up! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Yank, are you there? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Manry, wake up!” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I jumped out of the cabin and saw an English trawler with four or five men at the rail calling out between cupped hands.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I was surprised that they knew my name, but glad they had awakened me, for I knew I shouldn’t be sleeping in those heavily traveled waters. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And then, as I drew alongside I got another, bigger shock; they asked for my autograph! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They must be daft, I thought. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Why in the world would they, or anyone, want <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">my</i> autograph. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But I obliged, happily.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It turned out that the skipper of the trawler, the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trewarvenneth</i></span> , was a fine-looking Cornishman named Harry Small, and he was the brother-in-law of Captain Hunter of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> , the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trewarvenneth</i> ‘s</span> sister ship, which, by sheer coincidence, was scouring the ocean for me with Virginia aboard. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Captain Small soon had Captain Hunter on the radio telephone, told him he had found me and gave him our position. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And Captain Hunter replied that he was already headed for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> and would arrive in about four hours. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was delighted to know that in just that length of time I would see my lovely wife again.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I thanked the captain and crew of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trewarvenneth</i></span> , which then went on about its own business, and pushed on for the Lizard. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Soon things really began to pop.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">An R.A.F. <span class="SpellE">Shackleton</span> flew over and dropped another canister, this one with a message saying, “Sorry we have not been with you since Monday. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> You have done well. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Position now; 49° 32’ N, 06° 05’ W. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Manry aboard trawler PZ513. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Will home her to you now. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Cmdr. R. A. Carson, Royal Air Force.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The big plane started circling about, sending out that signal for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> .</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Then a handsome Royal Navy frigate, H.M.S. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brereton</i> , hove into sight and, after it got close enough, its captain and two sailors came over to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> in an inflated rubber boat powered with an outboard motor. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We had a wonderfully pleasant little visit as we moved along side by side. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The captain, Lieutenant Commander Nick Barker, gave me a bottle of fresh milk, the first I’d had in more than two and a half months. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’ll never forget how delicious it was. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He also gave me a sailor’s hat ribbon with H.M.S. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brereton</i> printed on it in letters of gold, as well as the pleasure and honor of signing my name in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brereton</i> ‘s guest book. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then he putt-putted back to his own ship, which also was emitting a homing signal for the and which began circling around like a mother hen watching over a chick.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Wonderful welcome,” I had written in the guest book, and it certainly was. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was so marvelous, so totally different from what I had expected, that it took on a sort of Alice in Wonderland quality, an out-of-this- <span class="SpellE">worldness</span> that left me numb.</p>
		<p>

		<p class="MsoNormal">Virginia’s diary for the previous seven days tells vividly her side of the story.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">” <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tuesday, August 10</i> -Poor Robert, the winds are practically gale force, and we heard tonight on <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> that he had been swept overboard several times. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Luckily, he has a lifeline around his waist. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He must be exhausted. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I do wish we could do something to help him.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Bill Jorgensen hired a trawler and went out and interviewed him. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Everyone in Cleveland knew it, but we didn’t. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Our boys are kind of put out. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I told them if they ever go to look for Robert to take me along, too.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">” <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wednesday, August 11</i> -We have chartered a trawler and Russ and Bill and Eric Piper, and Paul Hughes, a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Daily Mirror</i> reporter, and I are going to look for Robert. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It’s all very hush, hush. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I have to be up at 5 <abbr class="eoc">a.m.</abbr></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">” <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thursday, August 12</i> -We left the hotel at 6:30 and raced in Paul Hughes’ car to <span class="SpellE">Newlyn</span> [near Penzance]. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I’ll never get used to English driving. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It’s terrifying. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Paul says all it takes is ‘a bit of dash and verve.’</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Our trawler is the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> , and this is my first time on the sea. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It’s a lovely day and I’m enjoying it.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“The captain is Ernie Hunter and the crewmen are Jock Skinner, Bob <span class="SpellE">Sowden</span> and Bert Morris. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Bert is also the cook, and he gives us meals fit for any first-class hotel. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He’s really a whiz in the galley. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I don’t know how he does it.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“They all treat me like visiting royalty. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Jock told me about Scotland and Bob drew me a sketch of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> .</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">” <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Friday, August 13 to Sunday, August 15</i> -Our trawler trip was more like a pleasure cruise than anything else. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Sometimes I felt guilty for enjoying the cruise so much when poor Robert was alone in his little cockleshell in the vast ocean. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I did acquire a sense of oneness with him, though, which was impossible to feel ashore.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“We searched the horizon so diligently I began to see red sails everywhere I looked. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Looking out over the waves I could understand how it would be nearly impossible to find him without <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s red sail.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Paul and I had a tendency toward seasickness and we took all our meals at the stern of the boat. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Luckily, as long as I stayed out of the galley I was able to keep my meals down. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Bert told me to keep on eating, no matter whether I lost a meal or not. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The seasick pills made me groggy, so I did a lot of sleeping.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Paul, probably because of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">his</i> pills, was always flopping down somewhere to sleep. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> One time he curled up in one of the fish nets and went to sleep, and Bob sewed him up in it.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> has a terrific roll to it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It rolls so far over the sea comes in through the scuppers on one side and gets halfway across the deck. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then, when it rolls to the other side, the sea goes back out on the first side and in on the other side.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“The boys are in constant touch with land by radio. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And now and then Russ and Bill communicate with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Plain Dealer</i> by radio and transatlantic cable. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The fellows back at the newspaper can’t seem to understand why he can’t find Robert.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“We passed several trawlers. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> One of them we took to be French and among us we figured out enough French to ask if they had seen ‘ <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">un petit bateau avec rouge</i> sail.’ They stared at us in bewilderment and then gave us that peculiar sign, chopping the palm of one hand with the side of the other. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It turned out they were Dutch!</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“No sign or word of Robert and we have had to put back to <span class="SpellE">Newlyn</span> for more supplies and fuel. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I still feel he’s all right.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">” <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Monday, August 16</i> -I couldn’t get to sleep last night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The bed wasn’t rocking and it was too quiet. Guess I missed the sea. Anyhow, we got up early and made off to once again. This time, hopefully, we’ll find Robert.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“It was a sparkling, bright blue day and it felt good to have a deck under our feet again. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were all filled with high hopes.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Bert gave us some old bread, which we crumbled and tossed to the scores of gulls following us. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I couldn’t help remembering the last time I had thrown bread to the sea gulls was when Robert was loading his supplies aboard <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> in Falmouth, Massachusetts.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Russ and I had a conversation about my feelings concerning Robert’s safety. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I told him I felt that when Robert left Falmouth, Massachusetts, he became one of the sea creatures and, since God watches over them, I felt sure He had Robert in His care, too. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Maybe it was childish, but I felt I just had to have faith. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And what is life itself but many acts of faith? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I have believed from the beginning that worry would avail me nothing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It couldn’t possibly help Robert and it could drive me mad.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">‘While we were talking Bert came out and said, ‘The Captain wants you in the wheelhouse.’</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“I ran along the deck and climbed the little ladder into the wheelhouse. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Captain Hunter said he just heard by radio that his brother-in-law, the commander of another trawler, had found the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> a few miles southeast of the <span class="SpellE">Scilly</span> Isles. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Robert had been curled up in the cabin, asleep.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“From that moment on a carnival air prevailed aboard the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> with dancing on the deck and slapping of backs. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Soon an RAF plane flew over so close we all ducked and Captain Hunter, who had piloted a boat to help evacuate the British forces trapped at Dunkirk during World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, thought for a moment that he was back there.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Bert fixed us some sandwiches because there wouldn’t be time for a proper meal, and we were too excited to eat anyhow. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> moved at top speed to meet Robert and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> .</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“I remember Eric came up to me, took my chin in his hand and said, “Are you happy, <span class="SpellE">luv</span> ?”</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“I felt tears of joy springing into my eyes as I answered, ‘Oh, yes,’ and said a little prayer of thanks.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Dolphins, that had previously kept their distance, then began ducking underneath the trawler and diving from one side of it to the other. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then, as suddenly as they had appeared, they vanished.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Russ, up on the observation deck, shouted for us to come up there. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We all climbed up the ladder and saw what had become of the dolphins. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There were two on each side of the bow, escorting us to Robert. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What better sign of luck did we need?</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Captain Hunter kept scanning the horizon with his eagle eyes (no binoculars for him) and finally announced that he had spotted <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I don’t know about the others, but as for me, even using binoculars, it was a good long time before I made out that little red dot that was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s mainsail.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“But what a moment that was!”</p>
		<p>
</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">In three hours the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> was in sight and in less than another hour it was alongside and I got my first glimpse of Virginia. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> She looked great; tanned and fit, as though life at sea were agreeing with her. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And she had on slacks and a pretty blue jacket and hat that seemed just right. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I don’t remember what I said first or what she said. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Everything was so exciting and happening so fast. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My mind reeled.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I’m sure I must have said it was good to see her and, no doubt, she said she was happy to see me, but I can’t remember. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was too dazed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I must also have said “hellos” to Bill and Russ of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">P.D.</i> , and Paul Hughes and Eric Piper of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Daily Mirror</i> , to whom I was quickly introduced, and to Captain Hunter and his good crew. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were like a happy family having a wonderful time at a picnic.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Well, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> got you to England after all,” I called over to Virginia.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Yes,” she said. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> “Even got me here before you.”</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“When <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> was securely moored beside the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> , Virginia jumped down beside me and we hugged and kissed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was marvelous to have her in my arms again, to be together. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The photographers kept asking us to kiss and hug some more so they could get pictures and, of course, we didn’t mind. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We could have gone on for hours. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Virginia said she liked the looks of my mustache and didn’t mind the tickling. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was glad to hear that. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> She was also delighted with my slimmed-down looks. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (We discovered later that I had lost forty pounds.)</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">We sat down in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ‘s little cockpit with our arms around each other, but there was hardly any opportunity for a private conversation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The two photographers kept asking us to pose and the two reporters kept firing questions at us. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> All of us were spinning like tops in a scene of wild, happy confusion.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I found out later that Bill had told the Englishmen on the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> , ” <span class="SpellE">Wait’ll</span> you hear his laugh.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And I guess they weren’t disappointed, for I did considerable laughing and with as much gusto as ever. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It seems to me that moments of happiness are times for laughing, and I have seldom if ever been happier than I was at that reunion with Virginia. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Even the apprehension I had felt over Russ’s being the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">P.D.</i> promotion director disappeared, for I learned that there would be no brazen attempt to capitalize on my voyage. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I deeply appreciated the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">P.D.</i> ‘s</span> forbearance. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That made everything absolutely perfect. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Maybe old <abbr>Dr.</abbr> <span class="SpellE">Pangloss</span> was right after all; maybe this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">was</i> the best of all possible worlds.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Bert, the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Excellent</i> ‘s</span> chef, handed me a nice big mug of oxtail soup, but I was kept so busy answering questions I only had time to take a few sips of it before someone shouted, “We <span class="SpellE">gotta</span> get going,” and there was a mad scramble on the trawler to get Virginia back on board and return to <span class="SpellE">Newlyn</span> . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Virginia, it seemed, had become the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Plain Dealer</i> teams “secret weapon.” <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> By getting exclusive stories and pictures of her high-seas reunion with me the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">P.D.</i> men hoped to ease the pain of the</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">“Atlantic scoop” perpetrated by Jorgensen and Glendenning. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So, at the first sign of an approaching boatload of rival newsmen, they whisked the soup out of my hands and leaped to pull Virginia up onto the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They had to start moving, anyway, to get the story filed in time for the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">P.D.</i> ‘s</span> deadline.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Well, getting Virginia back up on the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> wasn’t nearly so simple as it had been to get her down onto the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Tinkerbelle</i> ; but Bill and Russ were willing to try. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They grabbed Virginia’s</p>
		<p align="CENTER">
			<img alt="Drawing of Virginia Manry being pulled aboard trawler" src="../images/tinkerp210.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">arms and pulled, thinking she would be able to help by getting a toe hold on the side of the ship. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But there was no place for a toe hold; the hull was too smooth. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So there she dangled suspended two or three feet above the water.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Virginia said later she had visions of having to hang there all the way back to <span class="SpellE">Newlyn</span> , if Russ’s and Bill’s arms held out. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Frankly, I didn’t have that much confidence in their arms. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I thought she’d drop into the water any second. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And there I was, unable to help because <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> had drifted too far away.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly Paul Hughes thought of a way to avert catastrophe and rushed forward. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He reached down to grab my darling wife by what he later referred to as her “haunches,” but then at the last second, he saw the horrified look on my face and decided he’d better not go through with it. He explained afterward that he wasn’t going to offend, knowingly, a man who had just sailed the Atlantic .</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The situation was becoming truly desperate when Bert, one of the crew (good old Bert, Virginia called him after that), lunged low enough to grab her ankles, raised them, and then rolled her inboard over the railing like a sack of flour. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Luckily neither of the photographers recorded the humiliating event.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">There was no time to observe the amenities. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We all waved quickly and then the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Excellent</i> sped away, <span class="SpellE">Newlyn</span> bound, just as the first boatload of rival newsmen arrived. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This new batch of reporters shouted over questions and I shouted back answers for thirty minutes or so as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> continued on toward the Lizard. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then the boat headed back to harbor, to be replaced by another boatful of curious interviewers. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It went on like that until darkness began to fall. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There were five or six boats altogether, I think, and believe me, some of those English journalists were go-getters. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Carl Dyer, a reporter for United Press International, wasn’t satisfied with shouting back and forth. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He stripped to his shorts, put on a pair of water wings and swam over to get a better look at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> and me. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And there was another chap-I didn’t get his name, I’m sorry to say-who tried to row over in his boat’s dinghy but got dumped into the sea instead.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Finally it was night and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> and I were alone together once more. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was our last night alone together; our last night on the sea.</p>
