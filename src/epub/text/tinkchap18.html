<p class=MsoNormal>Soon after night cloaked the sea, and before the moon arose,
I noticed the loom of a bright light brushing the sky to the northeast.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was pretty sure it couldn&#39;t be anything but
the Lizard Head Light, but I got out the light list to make certain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The book said the Lizard Light was white,
flashing, and had a period of three seconds, of which 0.1 second was flash and
2.9 seconds was eclipse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its strength
was 4,000,000 candle power.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hadn&#39;t
known there were lights that bright.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I timed the sweeps of the loom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the Lizard Head Light all right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A table in the front of the book indicated that the light,
which stood on a cliff and was two hundred and thirty feet above the water,
could be seen from a distance of about twenty miles.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, what I saw was not the light itself
but its beam in the sky, so we were undoubtedly a good deal farther from it than
that; probably closer to twenty-five miles away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be dawn before we got to it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
skipped joyfully over the waves, headed straight for the light like a horse
galloping toward the barn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was an
extra little jauntiness in the spread of her sails, an extra snap in her step,
an extra sauciness in the wiggle of her stern.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was proud of her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And happy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>She had guarded me well.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Although being knocked overboard had been frightening, especially the
first time, we had come through unscathed, thanks to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She simply
wasn&#39;t the sort of boat to leave one behind (unless she was rigged for
self-steering) because she had the admirable habit of facing the wind and
stopping whenever the tiller and mainsheet were released.</p>


<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p213">Page 213</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yes, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
had protected me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She had never allowed
herself to be turned bottom up (as I had feared might happen) and even on those
few occasions when one of the bigger breaking waves had flipped her over on her
beam ends she had righted herself at once.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If she had been able to steer herself all the way, I&#39;m sure she could
have crossed the ocean entirely on her own, without any help whatever from me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides righting herself after each knockdown, she had steadfastly</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>kept herself watertight and buoyant.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had expected that at some time along the
way she might be filled with water, which I would then have had laboriously to
pump out of her; but that calamity never even came close.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nor had there been any significant breakage
of her gear, aside from what happened to her rudders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> never
allowed me to get into a really serious predicament and, consequently, I never
became panic-stricken or fearful that we might not reach England safely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was confident of her
seaworthiness before I started the voyage (I wouldn&#39;t have started otherwise)
and grew more and more pleased with her capability as she demonstrated again
and again that my faith in her was not misplaced.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In my opinion she was, and is, a nautical
gem.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p214">Page 214</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were some scary moments, some moments of sharp
loneliness and some other moments of depression, but for the most part the
voyage was a great, glorious, happy adventure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I wouldn&#39;t have missed it for the world.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And as the fulfillment of a long-time dream, it had a special, deep
significance for me that only those persons who have long desired and then
achieved can fully appreciate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It had been an eventful voyage, too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The log revealed that I had sighted about
sixty ships in the vast expanse of ocean between Vineyard Sound and the <span
class=SpellE>Scilly</span> Isles; and, of these, two had looked <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle </i>and me over to make sure we
were all right, four others had exchanged words with me &#34;on the run&#34; and five
more had actually stopped to converse.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>One of these last five had also picked up letters to mail when it reached
port and another had given me a complete hot meal, the equivalent of a
banquet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had seen one or more vessels
on thirty-three days of the voyage (which now was approaching the end of its
seventy-seventh day) despite my efforts to stay away from the shipping
lanes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The longest I had gone without
sighting a ship was nine days, between June 21<sup>st</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All this, it seemed to me, pointed to the fact that the Atlantic was an exceptionally sociable ocean, and a crowded one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently I was never more than a few days
away from help if I had needed it and had used the Victory Girl emergency
transmitter to summon it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The tradition
of helping those in distress that exists on the sea was heart-warming to behold
in action, and I hoped all those captains who had taken the time to rush over
to rescue me, only to find that I didn&#39;t need rescuing, would forgive me for
causing them concern and delay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
saluted them with sincere thanks and respect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also owed a debt of gratitude to the U.S. Weather Bureau
and the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office, as their reports on winds and waves to
be expected on the voyage had proved astonishingly accurate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The larges waves had been twenty-footers, but
we hadn&#39;t met many of them, fortunately.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Most of the time</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p215">Page 215</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>the waves were under twelve feet high and the wind blew at
less than twenty-five knots.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were
forced to ride to the sea anchor thirteen times (not counting the times when I
was sleeping) and were becalmed thirteen times for varying periods, the longest
being about a day.</p>

<p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The moon had risen at about 9:30
 P.M. and had now, just before midnight,
added its magical touch to the channel scene as we continued slapping, sliding,
sloshing toward the Lizard Light.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
light itself was visible at last.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had
a strangely hypnotic effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few
minutes of staring at it made it seem very close, although the length of time
required to reach it proved it was still many miles away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
jogged along gaily at about four knots, I was enchanted by the sparkling <span
class=SpellE>moonglow</span> in the water and the warm lights of far-off
freighters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had felt we were sailing
through historic waters when we left Falmouth, Massachusetts, but now as we
approached Falmouth, England, that feeling was intensified a hundredfold.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What an utterly fascinating land this was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Falmouth, up
ahead, only a dozen miles beyond the flashing Lizard Light, was noted for many
things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Long ago Phoenician, Roman and
Greek traders had visited the site of the city seeking tin, corn and hides.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then came Danes and Vikings seeking conquests
and, after them, Frenchmen seeking revenge.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was from Falmouth that
Bartholomew <span class=SpellE>Gosnold</span> had sailed in 1602 on his voyage
of discovery to Cape Cod.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not certain that he landed at the site
of Falmouth, Massachusetts,
but at any rate he had sailed by, and when Cape Cod&#39;s Falmouth was incorporated in 1686 it took the name of the town from which he had begun
his voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the two <span
class=SpellE>Falmouths</span> definitely were linked in history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was to England&#39;s
Falmouth that the schooner <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Pickle</i> brought the official news of
Nelson&#39;s tragic death in 1805 at the moment of his greatest triumph, the defeat
of a combined</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p216">Page 216</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>French and Spanish fleet off Cape Trafalgar on the southern coast of Spain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was from Falmouth that a British warship sailed to take Napoleon to this exile on the island of St. Helena.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And it was into Falmouth that Captain Kurt <span class=SpellE>Carlsen</span> and his first mate, Kenneth
<span class=SpellE>Dancy</span>, were brought in January, 1952, after being
rescued from the freighter <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Flying
Enterprise</i>, which, after their heroic fourteen&#45;day struggle to get it into
port, sank off the Lizard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a matter
of fact, the trawlers <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i> and <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> had participated in the
dramatic <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Flying Enterprise</i> rescue
effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Falmouth Harbor also had been the jumping-off point or terminus of quite a few transatlantic
small-boat voyages.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voyage of the
18-foot <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>City of </i><i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bath</i>, begun in Newfoundland,
had ended there in 1881.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So had the 1947
voyage of the 22-foot <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Adventure</i>,
which had begun at Miami, Florida.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voyage of the 17-foot raft <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>L&#39;Egare</i></span>, sailed
from Halifax in 1956, ended there, too, as did the 1960 voyage of the 26 ½
-foot <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Humming Bird</i>, which had started
at Antigua in the West Indies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Headed
the other way across the Western Ocean, Humphrey Barton and Kevin <span
class=SpellE>O&#39;Riordon</span> sailed the 25-foot <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vertue</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> XXXV</i> from Falmouth to New York in 1950; Ernst <span class=SpellE>Karulis</span>
and Jan <span class=SpellE>Paltins</span> sailed the 25-foot <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Polaris</i> from there to Panama in
1949-1950, and Patrick <span class=SpellE>Ellam</span> and Colin <span
class=SpellE>Mudie</span> jumped off from the same place on their voyage in <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sopranino</i></span> in
1951.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other voyages begun at Falmouth were those of the 31-foot <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Uldra</i></span>, 24-foot <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wanderer
II</i>, 29-foot <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Moonraker</i></span>
(Dr. E. A. &#34;Peter&#34; <span class=SpellE>Pye&#39;s</span> famous cutter), 20-foot <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Skaffie</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>and 25 ½ foot <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Valkyr</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>.</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I gazed at the flashing light ahead and wondered what <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s voyage had accomplished.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, for one thing, it had helped to make an
honest man of me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I had asked Virginia
to marry me I had promised her two things:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>one, that we would travel, and two, that although I might be a headache
I would never, never be a bore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, in
fifteen years of marriage we had had a couple of vacation trips to Canada, but
it could hardly be said that I was making good on the</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p217">Page 217</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>promise of travel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And as for the second pledge, after twelve years on the rim of a
newspaper copy desk I was becoming a crashing bore, without even the relief of
being interesting enough to be a headache.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So the situation was critical.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was beginning to look as though I had lied and had married Virginia under false pretenses.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> saved the day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She banished boredom from our lives and,
although she sometimes became a bit of a headache, it only made her that much
more interesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And she made good on
my promise of travel for she took me to England and in the process influenced
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i> to send Virginia and
the children over to meet me, an exceedingly kind and gracious act on the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span> part.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia appreciated it immensely, I knew, because for years she had dreamed of visiting
England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
made a dream of hers come true as well as one of mine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What had the voyage achieved besides making dreams a
reality?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think probably the most
important thing it had done for me was to enable me to stand back, away from
human society ashore, and look at life for a little while from a new perspective.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a sense, the Atlantic Ocean
had been a personal Walden Pond on which I had lived
simply, in close communion with nature, confronted by elemental dangers and
necessities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It certainly had not been a
place for trivialities and I think, perhaps, that fact may have done something
to make me a better person inside than I had been before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, I hope it did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Although I was lonely and discouraged at times, my primary
feeling was of contentment and peace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
boat was my dearest companion and though the wind and sea were sometimes my
adversaries, they were mostly friendly and even when they were not they behaved
with straightforward honesty according to their inherent natures.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To know them was to respect them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I must confess that, seen from the peace and quiet of
mid-ocean, many aspects of life on land seemed grim indeed. Well, we might as
well face it; in some basic ways life ashore <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>is</i> grim, especially for underprivileged or <span class=SpellE>underequipped</span>
persons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p218">Page 218</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>couldn&#39;t help thinking of the gray flannel suit brigades in
big cities ashore, living in a kind of lock-step frenzy, battling noisy highway
or subway traffic to get to work in the morning and to return home in the
evening, existing on pure nervous energy in between, having to be ever alert to
opportunities to get ahead and on guard against the encroachment of rivals.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Henry Thoreau said, &#34;The mass of men lead lives of quiet
desperation,&#34; and he was probably right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In my life, certainly, there had been many periods of quiet desperation,
although I was sure my existence had been less harried than that of most
men.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I shuddered to think what those
less fortunate than I were enduring.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the implications of these musings was that my voyage
in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> had been prompted by
an itch and was itself a form of scratching.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That was true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voyage was
something I simply <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>had </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>to do, had wanted to do for a long, long
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, I had wanted to do it so
intensely and for such a long time that my natural timidity, the basic Walter <span
class=SpellE>Mitty</span>&#45;<span class=SpellE>Caspar</span> Milquetoast cast of
my character, had finally been beefed up with a fair-sized dash of Captain
Ahab.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And that&#39;s when planning for the
cruise had got under way in earnest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story in the Falmouth <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Packet</i> had referred to me as a hero,
but that was absurd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As far as I was
concerned, I wasn&#39;t taking any great risks, and I was doing something I enjoyed
intensely.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I really couldn&#39;t understand
why so much excitement was developing in Falmouth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d heard on the radio that a tremendous
welcome was being planned and that the mayor had even postponed his vacation in
order to be there to greet me when I stepped ashore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And there was talk of thousands of people
being on hand to watch <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
arrive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seemed as though a real
ordeal was shaping up for me and I&#39;ll have to admit that for a few moments I
considered turning off to port and heading for <span class=SpellE>Penzance</span>
in order to escape it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A huge welcome by crowds of people and the mayor and all
that sort of thing was a far cry from what I had expected.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p219">Page 219</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>thought that since England was a maritime nation and had had her full share of adventurous sailors little
mention would be paid to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prior to my discovery of what was
going on ashore, I had expected to sail into Falmouth Harbor almost unnoticed,
moor my boat at a dock and go to a hotel for a nice bath and sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, in the morning, I would look for the Falmouth representative of the Associated Press, tell him that I had just sailed the
Atlantic <span class=SpellE>singlehanded</span> and that I thought my newspaper
back in the States might be interested in having a story about it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, it appeared, it wasn&#39;t going to work out
quite like that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The impulse to duck away from all the hoopla that was being
prepared in Falmouth was strong, but then I thought of how wonderful the R.A.F.
had been to me and how well I had been treated by the personnel of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i>, <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Trewarvenneth</i></span>, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Excellent</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Brereton</i> and that my family
and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> colleagues were waiting for
me in Falmouth, not to mention the mayor and the crowds, and that I was to be a
guest in the country, anyway.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would
be inexcusable to skip out and dash the hopes and expectations of all those
people, so I decided to go on in as I had planned and face the music.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Dawn was approaching now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The stars disappeared as the inky blackness of the sky gradually changed
to gray and then grew lighter and lighter with each passing minute.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Up ahead the Lizard Light was still flashing
faithfully with its regular three-second rhythm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not yet possible to tell how near or far
it was, for judging distances over water was extremely difficult, especially
when there was nothing of a known size to gauge by.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We kept going as we had all night before the southwest
breeze, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> taking it over
the port quarter, heeling pleasantly to starboard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>More light filled the heavens.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, in another thirty minutes or so, the
outline of a steep headland could be distinguished from the sea and sky.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Land!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>At last!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Land!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Solid, firm, immovable land!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was Lizard Head rising</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p220">Page 220</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>steeply from the ocean; and rolling northeastward from it
was the pleasant, green, undulating shoreline leading to Falmouth!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a breath-taking view, and it grew even more striking
as the daylight increased in intensity and revealed the details of rocky
cliffs, lovely green trees and even greener fields, attractively landscaped
houses and interestingly winding roads.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I consumed it with my eyes, spellbound, transported, enraptured.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What a sublime sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Only twelve miles to go,&#34; I told <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The thought brought on a faint stabbing of pain.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voyage was almost over.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was in its hoary old age, moving swiftly
toward its end, its death.</p>
