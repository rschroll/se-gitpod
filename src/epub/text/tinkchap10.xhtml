		<p class="MsoNormal">In the morning of the eighth day, as I lay asleep, a sound insinuated itself into my unconscious mind and tugged me toward wakefulness. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It had the tone and timbre of a chorus of shouts-men's shouts. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But that was absurd. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Men's choruses simply didn't go about the Atlantic shouting. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I must have dreamed it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I squirmed into a new position under my blanket and began to drift back into sleep. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then suddenly I was exploded into wide-eyed consciousness by:</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">" <span class="SpellE">Ahyouuuuuuuuuuga</span> ! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> <span class="SpellE">Ahyouuuuuuuuuuuga</span> !"</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><i>That</i> was no dream! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Such a dreadful, ear-busting noise could mean only one thing: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> my time on earth was up. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And when I identified the accompanying roar as that of diesels I was sure of it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Without a doubt a big ship was bearing down on <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and noticing her at the last minute, too late to swerve aside, it had sounded its klaxon in a desperate bid to save the life of whoever was aboard her. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Any second now there would be a grinding crash as the ship plowed us under. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My one chance of survival was to abandon <i>Tinkerbelle</i> at once and swim for it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> If I moved fast enough, I might get out of the ship's path in time.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">When I realized what I had to do and that my life depended on it, I sprang into action. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I must have been hitting Mach 3 as I threw open the cabin hatch and flew out on deck ready to dive overboard.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately I was moving just slowly enough to have half a second to notice that, really, there was no ship headed toward us, and pull myself to a halt before plunging over the side. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were not about to be run down, but what I saw nearly made my eyes pop out of their sockets. Lying alongside , so close I could almost have jumped aboard her, was an enormous submarine. And on its bridge, staring at me, were three or four men, no doubt the chorus I'd heard.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I felt foolish. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> To be scared out of my wits was bad enough, but to be scared thus in front of an audience was too embarrassing to bear. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I tried to salvage my pride by deftly changing my expression of panic into an expression of nonchalant greeting,</p>
		<p align="CENTER">
			<img alt="Drawing of Manry with submarine." src="../images/tinkerp107.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">which, I hoped, would convey the impression that, far from being hurried by fright, I was accustomed to shooting out of the cabin like that every morning, and equally used to meeting submarines on the high seas. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It's a shame my performance wasn't caught on film, for it may have been worthy of an Academy Award. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Or it may have served a useful purpose, later, as a medical-school exhibit on the muscular contortions a human face can achieve. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Despite my histrionics, however, I had a suspicion the men on the sub weren't the least bit deceived, and I learned afterward the suspicion was well founded; they knew I was in a blue funk.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">What should I say? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What should I do? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was racking my brain for answers to those questions, and trying to decide what the sub might want or do, when one of the men on the bridge (I heard subsequently it was the captain) called out, "Do you need any help?"</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">So that was it. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They thought I was in some sort of trouble, I felt a great load slide off my shoulders, for I had begun to have wild notions such as maybe war had been declared since I'd left shore, or maybe the Coast Guard had sent the sub out to stop me from making what it considered a foolhardy voyage. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Actually, it had only stumbled onto me, thought I was in distress and wanted to help. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That was all.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I appreciated the offer of assistance immensely, but in my startled condition I could think of nothing I needed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So I shouted back, "No, thanks!"</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Whereupon we lapsed into numbed silence, for the men on the submarine undoubtedly were as astonished by the sight of <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and me as I was at seeing them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We couldn't think of anything to say. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We just stood there looking blankly, unbelievingly, at one another as we slowly drifted farther and farther apart. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Soon we were so far apart we couldn't have made ourselves heard, even if we'd wanted to, over the shuddering clangor of the sub's engines. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (I had no idea submarines, even non-nuclear subs like this one, made so much noise while running on the surface.) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As the sub's stern passed by, I saw markings which told me it was an American craft, the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> , named after a Eurasian fish noted for its ability to survive out of water. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Finally its propellers began turning and in a very short time it slid out of sight over the horizon.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">When I had recovered my composure, I berated myself for two serious omissions: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> one of courtesy, the other of seamanship. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I felt I should have invited the sub's skipper over for a <span class="SpellE">gam</span> and a cup of coffee, and I should have asked him for a position report against which to check the accuracy of my navigation. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I managed to get along without the position report, but my failure in courtesy was not so easily overlooked. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> After my voyage was completed, I wrote a letter of apology to the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i> 's</span> skipper, Lieutenant Commander James A. Bacon, and he replied, kindly, with his impression of our meeting.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"At 0800 on 7 June," he wrote, " <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> <i>
 </i> departed New London for sea. On arriving at Nantucket Lightship in the early evening of the 7 <sup>th</sup> fog and numerous fishing vessels impeded our progress. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As a result I spent the night in the <span class="SpellE">conn</span> or on the bridge.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"First light found <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> some 150 miles east south east of the lightship with the fog clearing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As the sun rose we broke out of the fog and the lookouts [one of them was a Yeoman Robert R. <span class="SpellE">Rentschler</span> , a fellow Cleveland suburbanite] spotted a very small mast on the horizon some distance to the south of our track.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"At first I thought the mast belonged to one of the trawlers we had been playing tag with all night, but as we approached it became apparent that it belonged to a small sailboat. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> At this point I altered course to pass close aboard in order to hail the boat.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"When the small size of the boat became obvious, I thought it probably had been blown out to sea and no one would be aboard. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Until this time no one had been seen in the boat and now I decided to stop alongside and examine it in detail. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As we approached within a few hundred yards, it could be seen that the boat was riding to a sea anchor and was provided with oars and other gear lying in the after section-the forward area being decked over and having a small cabin.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"I stopped <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> with <i>Tinkerbelle</i> about 10 yards abeam of the bridge, and we continued our examination. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Although no on had been sighted on board, it now was apparent that someone could very well be in the cabin. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Mustering all the lung power of the bridge watch and using a megaphone, we hailed the <i>Tinkerbelle</i> but to no avail. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It became obvious after a few minutes that if there was in fact someone on board another means would have to be found to rouse them.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"The solution to the problem was readily available. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I reached over and gave a long blast on the ship's whistle, and there you were, leaping out of a small cabin as if you thought you were about to be run down by the <i>Queen Mary</i> or some equally large ship. I must now admit that I found your reaction somewhat amusing.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"We exchanged greetings as you have already stated. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> After you gave a negative response to my offer of assistance, I was at a loss for words. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Since I had been delayed during the night and there was a good chance I was going to be late arriving at my assigned station. I proceeded on at best speed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I came to the conclusion that you were where you wanted to be and little could be gained by <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> remaining in your vicinity. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I entered your position (39° 46' N, 66° 27' W) and the name of your boat in the ship's log in case the Coast Guard should start looking for you.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"I thought at the time that you most probably were a sailing enthusiast on vacation and sailing to Halifax from Boston or some place in the Cape area. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I am sincerely glad that I did not know what your true destination was. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I am sure that if I had known what you were attempting, I would have had a guilty conscience on leaving you there."</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I, too, am glad Lieutenant Commander Bacon was spared the pain of a guilty conscience. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There really was no reason for him to have had one, even if he had known where I was bound, because, as he said in his letter, I was where I "wanted to be"; no one had dropped me off there against my will. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And, since I was there of my own choice, I had won the right to experience whatever that entailed, good or bad. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So far it had been mostly very good and I was optimistic about the future.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I have just one bone to pick with Captain Bacon: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> he called that noise he made with his submarine a "whistle." <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> How euphemistic can you get? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I've called it a klaxon sound, but even that falls pitifully short of being an adequate description. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There simply is no word for the sound the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> produced, a sound that seemed to be a nerve-jangling synthesis of the wailing of banshees, the booming of thunder and the screeching of all the demons of hell.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Tinkerbelle</i> spent the hours of darkness after our meeting with the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> riding big waves to her sea anchor while I tried as best I could to rest in her cockpit. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was a chilly, wet, miserable, dragged-out night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was still too afraid of a capsize to seek shelter in the cabin when the waves were ominously large, so I had to bear the discomforts of the cockpit. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It wasn't easy to sleep in that exposed, perpetually joggling place.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The next morning (Wednesday, June 9 <sup>th</sup> ) the wind continued to blow at twenty-five or thirty knots and my bleary eyes got their first good look at the waves that, until then, had been partly hidden by the mantle of night. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Some of them must have been seventeen- or eighteen-footers, the biggest waves we'd yet encountered. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I watched them in awe and was mightily pleased and relieved to see how gracefully <i>Tinkerbelle</i> climbed to the summit of each one in turn, glissaded into the valley beyond and then climbed the next peak, on and on. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> My little craft performed her nautical functions with all the agility and stamina of a ballet dancer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was delighted with her and praised her to the skies.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The threatening waves were not to be trifled with; I was sure of that. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was better to be wary of them than wrecked by them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was equally true, though, that every minute we stayed tied to the sea anchor meant another minute added to the duration of our voyage, and a lot of those extra minutes could add up to one or more of several different crises that ought to be avoided, if possible. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Consequently, I was eager to be moving.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Still, the waves held me transfixed with fright. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I tried to envision what it would be like to brave them under sail and the only pictures that came into my mind were of disasters. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Did <span class="SpellE">Si</span> <span class="SpellE">Lawlor</span> in his little <i>Sea Serpent</i> and William Andrews in his collapsible <span class="SpellE"><i>Sapolio</i></span> sail through waves like these? <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That they might have done so seemed unbelievable, utterly fantastic. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Yet <span class="SpellE">Lawlor</span> got across the ocean in only forty-five days, an astounding accomplishment for a boat only fifteen feet long. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Andrews, in a boat half a foot shorter and with a greater distance to go, took eighty-four days, but he couldn't have achieved even that mark if he had spent much time hitched to a sea anchor.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I wrestled with fear through the whole morning as I studied the waves. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Finally, in the early afternoon, the conviction grew that we should get under way. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> "After all," I wrote in the log, "The whitecaps are small even though the waves are big." <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> So, marshaling all my courage, I decided to put up one of the small jibs and proceed tentatively under it alone. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> If conditions proved to be too hazardous, I'd get the sail down again immediately and go back to the sea anchor.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I steeled my nerves and we started moving eastward once more. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was sure that, even under just the one small jib, we would take off like a jet-driven aquaplane. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But I was wrong. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We barely crawled. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I had to hoist the <span class="SpellE">mains'l</span> , too, to get <i>Tinkerbelle</i> to move at a satisfactory pace. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> (However, I'm happy to be able to add that as the voyage progressed my ability to size up sailing conditions improved.)</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I tried to get some pictures of Mother Carey's chickens (storm petrels) the next afternoon, June 10 <sup>th</sup> , but they moved so fast it was extremely difficult. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They were fascinating to watch, though, because of their odd habit of walking on the water. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I'd never seen these birds before, although I had crossed the Atlantic several times previously on ocean liners.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The book Virginia had given me said they were Wilson's storm petrels, migrants from the Antarctic and the commonest members of the storm petrel family. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Mother Carey, it said, was a corruption of Mater Cara, an appellation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and storm petrel was derived from Saint Peter, who also walked on the water, according to the Bible, until his lack of faith brought on a ducking. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The Maoris of New Zealand had a poetic term for the birds, " <span class="SpellE"><i>takahi</i></span> <i><span class="SpellE">kare</span> <span class="SpellE">moana</span></i> ," which meant "dancing on the waters." <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I thought that was a particularly apt description.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Wilson's bird was a little smaller than a robin, brownish-gray and black, with a white spot at the base of its tail. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Sometimes it seemed to hop along on the water, sometimes it used its feet like skis and sometimes it simply walked. Two or three times I was amused by a bird that just stood on the water flapping its wings, as though it were trying to pull its feet out of hardening cement.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Not once did I see Wilson's storm petrels <i>in</i> the water, floating and resting like little water birds. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They were always flying, beating their wings without letup, moving erratically like butterflies and usually very close to the water's surface. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They must be tireless creatures, or else embarrassed to have anyone see them inactive. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The bird book said they occasionally alighted on</p>
		<p align="CENTER">
			<img alt="Drawing of Robert Manry watching storm petrels." src="../images/tinkerp113.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">the water, but I never saw one do so, although I watched them intermittently all the way across the ocean.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">One other variety of bird accompanied me almost all the way to England, the greater shearwater, a brown-and-white bird about twenty inches long, with a wingspread of more than two feet. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I also saw, occasionally, pretty black-and-white terns and of course, gulls.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The greater shearwater was a lovely bird to watch in flight, it rode the wind so elegantly. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It, unlike the storm petrel, was frequently to be seen bobbing on the water, resting or feeding. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> However, it never accepted the tidbits I offered.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">One day I came upon an oceanic melodrama, a tragedy of the sea in which the innocent victims were little fishes, probably herring, and the villains were giant tuna and ravenous shearwaters. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The poor herring found themselves in a terrible fix: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> if they stayed in the water the tuna got them, and if they jumped out of the water in their frantic efforts to escape the tuna followed right on their tails; besides which, in the air or near the surface, the shearwaters got them. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> They were trapped between two devils and the deep blue sea: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> doomed, no matter what they did.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I watched this battle for survival with something approaching horror-stricken fascination. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The greedy tuna and shearwaters gorged themselves on the hapless herring. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But as <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I drew within twenty yards or so all the shearwaters in the area, alarmed at the sight of us, took to their wings. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> All except one, that is. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This particular bird cut loose with a great squawking and flapping of wings, but, try as it would, it couldn't get airborne. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> At first I thought the squawks and the inability to fly meant it had been injured-by a tuna, perhaps-and was in distress, so I headed toward it with the intention of seeing if I could render first aid. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> However, in a very short time it became clear that the bird was simply cussing itself out in bird language for having eaten so <span class="SpellE">piggishly</span> that it was now too heavy to take off. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And, believe me, that bird knew how to cuss. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I am no prig and yet I was shocked! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And so were the tuna, for, as the air turned blue, they left.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">As we bore down on the bird, its cursing and <span class="SpellE">wingbeats</span> became more frenzied. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Finally, goaded by fear into making one last, do-or-die, <span class="SpellE">superbird</span> effort, it flogged itself into the air like an overloaded cargo plane and lumbered away. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I don't know bird language, so I can't say for sure what it said as it fought for altitude, but the tone and inflection sounded like "Gee-hookers! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That was a close one!"</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Shortly after sunset I noticed the barometer was down a tenth of an inch. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That wasn't much of a drop, but sure enough it began to blow hard and I had to stream the sea anchor again.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Wow! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> What a night!" <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I wrote in the log the next morning (June 11 <sup>th</sup> ), "I hope I don't have to go through any more like that, but I probably will. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was cold, too, as the wind had shifted from west to north."</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The wind relaxed a little at about 12:30 P.M., however, and then the sun came out for the first time in three days and we had a gloriously sunny, warm afternoon of sailing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I hove to contentedly in the moonlight at about ten that night and, just before going below to sleep, saw a big liner rumble westward a few miles north of us, its portholes agleam and its decks bathed in soft light.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The next morning, I awoke at about sunrise after a full seven hours of warm, relaxed sleep, and lay there in the cabin luxuriating in the pleasure of being rocked gently by the waves. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Sounds of water had enchanted and soothed me all my life: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> the roar of a fast-flowing stream in a valley of the Himalayas; the patter of monsoon rain on the tin roof of our home in <span class="SpellE">Landour</span> ; the crash and hiss of breakers hitting the beach at Ventnor, New Jersey, where our family had thrice vacationed; the slap and gurgle of Lake Erie fresh-water waves around the <span class="SpellE">breakwall</span> at Wildwood Park harbor and now the happy laughter of Atlantic saltwater billows as they toyed playfully with <i>Tinkerbelle</i> .</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It was Saturday, June 12 <sup>th</sup> , and one of those "God's-in-His-heaven-all's-right-with-the-world" mornings that come along every once in a while to give you a taste of how wonderful life can be. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And then, just as I was beginning to slip into utter harmony with the delights of the environment, I became conscious of a subtle something. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I heard nothing whatever that could be termed alien or out of place and yet, gradually, imperceptibly, I was infused with an eerie feeling that <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I were not alone, that we had company. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was an uncanny sensation, as if I were on the receiving end of a telepathic message.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I opened the hatch and went topside. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Good Lord! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There was another vessel!</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">This was much larger than the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> . <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It towered above us, its tremendous bow jutting higher than <i>Tinkerbelle</i> 's masthead. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was a Canadian naval vessel and to me, then only twenty-five yards away, it seemed large enough to be a battleship. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> However, I found out later it was a destroyer escort, H.M.C.S. <i>Columbia</i> , a beautiful light-gray ship with a well-cared-for look about it.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">At the <i>Columbia</i> 's rail, when I emerged from the cabin, was an officer in a smart white uniform. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> He had an electronic megaphone in his hands and, when he saw me, he used it to project his voice across the water between us.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Good morning," he said cheerily.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">His friendly tone and casual manner seemed to imply that the sole mission assigned to the <i>Columbia</i> by Royal Canadian Navy Headquarters was to conduct a genteel wake-up service for <span class="SpellE">singlehanded</span> Atlantic yachtsmen.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Hi!" <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I yelled back, attempting to sound just as casual and cheery as the naval person at the rail above me.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Are you all right?" he asked.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Everything's AOK here!" <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I shouted.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Then I remembered what I had neglected to ask the captain of the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> and added, "But I'd appreciate it if you'd give me a line on my position."</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Will do."</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">As we waited for the <i>Columbia</i> 's navigator to work out the position, the officer asked me where I had come from and where I was bound and what my craft's name was. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I yelled back the replies and asked him if he would report <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and me to the Coast Guard in Boston and he said he would. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Then the position report came. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were at 40° 17'N and 63° 7'W. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> That was great news! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It showed that my navigation was reasonably accurate, for the position I had calculated was less than six miles from that given by the <i>Columbia</i> 's navigator.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">It was a tremendous relief to find out that my sun shots and calculations hadn't gone haywire; that, apparently, I had got the hang of it and could now rely on my sextant and arithmetic to take <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and me where we wanted to go. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I grew confident that we actually would land at Falmouth, England, and not unexpectedly at some other port.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"Smooth sailing to you," called the <i>Columbia</i> 's blithe officer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> And I yelled back, "Thanks! <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Same to you!"</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Then the big ship quietly pulled away stern first, turned northward and moved off with an air of majesty, its red-and-white ensign fluttering in the breeze. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> For the first time since we'd met, I looked about the ocean. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> There were three other warships in sight and off to the west airplanes were streaking through the sky. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I must be mixed up in some naval maneuvers I said to myself. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It turned out I was right, but at that moment I didn't know how right.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Later I learned that <i>Columbia</i> , commanded by Commander P. R. Hinton, was participating in Exercise Polestar as a member of the NATO Matchmaker Squadron, which was composed of four ships, one each from Great Britain, Holland, the United States and Canada. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> The three other ships I'd seen undoubtedly were those of Britain, Holland and the United States.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">"On the morning of 12 June at 0615," Commander A. C. <span class="SpellE">McMillin</span> of the Royal Canadian Navy wrote to me, " <i>Columbia</i> was patrolling her station when ordered to investigate a small radar contact. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> This contact turned out to be the <i>Tinkerbelle</i> , and at first sight it appeared to be derelict, as there was no sign of life. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> As <i>Columbia</i> came alongside <i>Tinkerbelle</i> you appeared and spoke to Sub-Lt. E. J. Kelley, who was the officer-of-the-watch at the time."</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">I learned, too that Exercise Polestar was an antisubmarine exercise in which units of the United States and Canadian Navies and the NATO squadron were divided into teams and pitted against one another. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> In fact, the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> was a participant, but on the side opposite the <i>Columbia</i> , as the "enemy."</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Meeting both "friend" and "foe" in a naval exercise was a thrilling experience, one I shall remember always. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> But I feel mortified about the way <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I blundered like bumpkins into those war games and diverted two vessels, for some minutes, from their important assigned duties. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> Here and now I want to thank the officers and men of the <span class="SpellE"><i>Tench</i></span> <i>
 </i> and <i>Columbia</i> for their solicitous concern for our safety and, humbly, beg the Navies of Great Britain, Holland, the United States and Canada to pardon our intrusion.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">The next night, following our encounter with H.M.C.S. <i>Columbia</i> , we had another beautiful, easygoing sail in the moonlight until about 11:45 P.M., when I turned in.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">On Sunday, June 13 <sup>th</sup> , I awoke to find a stiff breeze blowing so I kept <i>Tinkerbelle</i> tethered to the bucket drogue and utilized the time that gave me away from the tiller to rearrange the stowage of my supplies. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I was getting more and more fed up with having to root through nearly everything I had to find what I wanted. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I also took the opportunity to write some letters, to Virginia and others, which I hoped a passing ship might eventually pick up and mail for me when it reached port. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> We were hove to for seven or eight hours, altogether, not counting the night hours when I was sleeping. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> It was quite a pleasant time, on the whole, for the waves were not quite big enough to scare me out of the comfort of the cabin, but I was impatient and fretful because we weren't moving eastward. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> In fact, we were falling behind on the schedule I'd set and if we didn't get cracking soon it would take more than three months to reach England instead of the two months I had estimated.</p>
		<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, the wind abated a little at about one in the afternoon. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span> I hauled in the sea anchor, put a tuck in the <span class="SpellE">mains'l</span> and the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tinkerbelle</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: italic">spread her red-and-white wings. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
  </span> We took off at top speed.</span></p>
