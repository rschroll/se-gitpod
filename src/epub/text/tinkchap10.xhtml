<p class=MsoNormal>In the morning of the eighth day, as I lay asleep, a sound
insinuated itself into my unconscious mind and tugged me toward
wakefulness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had the tone and timbre
of a chorus of shouts&#45;men&#39;s shouts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
that was absurd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Men&#39;s choruses simply
didn&#39;t go about the Atlantic shouting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
must have dreamed it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I squirmed into a
new position under my blanket and began to drift back into sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then suddenly I was exploded into wide-eyed
consciousness by:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<span class=SpellE>Ahyouuuuuuuuuuga</span>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Ahyouuuuuuuuuuuga</span>!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>That</i> was no dream!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Such a dreadful, ear-busting noise could mean only one thing:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>my time on earth was up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And when I identified the accompanying roar
as that of diesels I was sure of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Without a doubt a big ship was bearing down on <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and
noticing her at the last minute, too late to swerve aside, it had sounded its
klaxon in a desperate bid to save the life of whoever was aboard her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Any second now there would be a grinding
crash as the ship plowed us under.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
one chance of survival was to abandon <i>Tinkerbelle</i> at once and swim for
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I moved fast enough, I might get
out of the ship&#39;s path in time.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>When I realized what I had to do and that my life depended
on it, I sprang into action.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must have
been hitting Mach 3 as I threw open the cabin hatch and flew out on deck ready
to dive overboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately I was moving just slowly enough to have half a
second to notice that, really, there was no ship headed toward us, and pull
myself to a halt before plunging over the side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We were not about to be run down, but what I saw nearly made my</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>eyes pop out of their sockets.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lying alongside <i>Tinkerbelle</i>, so close
I could almost have jumped aboard her, was an enormous submarine.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And on its bridge, staring at me, were three
or four men, no doubt the chorus I&#39;d heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I felt foolish.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To be
scared out of my wits was bad enough, but to be scared thus in front of an
audience was too embarrassing to bear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
tried to salvage my pride by deftly changing my expression of panic into an
expression of nonchalant greeting, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>which, I hoped, would convey the impression that, far from
being hurried by fright, I was accustomed to shooting out of the cabin like
that every morning, and equally used to meeting submarines on the high
seas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s a shame my performance wasn&#39;t
caught on film, for it may have been worthy of an Academy Award.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or it may have served a useful purpose,
later, as a medical-school exhibit on the muscular contortions a human face can
achieve.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Despite my histrionics,
however, I had a suspicion the men on the sub weren&#39;t the least bit deceived,
and I learned afterward the suspicion was well founded; they knew I was in a
blue funk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What should I say?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What should I do?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was racking
my brain for answers to those questions, and trying to decide what the sub
might want or do, when one of the men on the bridge (I heard subsequently it was the captain) called out, &#34;Do you
need any help?&#34;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>So that was it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
thought I was in some sort of trouble, I felt a great load slide off my
shoulders, for I had begun to have wild notions such as maybe war had been
declared since I&#39;d left shore, or maybe the Coast Guard had sent the sub out to
stop me from making what it considered a foolhardy voyage. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Actually, it had only stumbled onto me,
thought I was in distress and wanted to help.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That was all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I appreciated the offer of assistance immensely, but in my
startled condition I could think of nothing I needed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I shouted back, &#34;No, thanks!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whereupon we lapsed into numbed silence, for the men on the
submarine undoubtedly were as astonished by the sight of <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and
me as I was at seeing them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We couldn&#39;t
think of anything to say.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We just stood
there looking blankly, unbelievingly, at one another as we slowly drifted
farther and farther apart.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Soon we were
so far apart we couldn&#39;t have made ourselves heard, even if we&#39;d wanted to,
over the shuddering clangor of the sub&#39;s engines.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(I had no idea submarines, even non-nuclear
subs like this one, made so much noise while running on the surface.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the sub&#39;s stern passed by, I saw markings
which told me it was an American craft, the <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span>,
named after a Eurasian fish noted for its ability to survive out of water.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally its propellers began turning and in a
very short time it slid out of sight over the horizon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I had recovered my composure, I berated myself for two
serious omissions:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>one of courtesy, the
other of seamanship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt I should
have invited the sub&#39;s skipper over for a <span class=SpellE>gam</span> and a
cup of coffee, and I should have asked him for a position report against which
to check the accuracy of my navigation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I managed to get along without the position report, but my failure in
courtesy was not so easily overlooked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After my voyage was completed, I wrote a letter of apology to the <span
class=SpellE><i>Tench</i>&#39;s</span> skipper, Lieutenant Commander James A.
Bacon, and he replied, kindly, with his impression of our meeting.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;At 0800 on 7 June,&#34; he wrote, &#34;<span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span><i>
</i>departed New London for sea.  On
arriving at Nantucket Lightship in the early evening of the 7<sup>th</sup> fog
and numerous fishing vessels impeded our progress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a result I spent the night in the <span
class=SpellE>conn</span> or on the bridge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;First light found <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span>
some 150 miles east south east of the lightship with the fog clearing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the sun rose we broke out of the fog and
the lookouts [one of them was a Yeoman Robert R. <span class=SpellE>Rentschler</span>,
a fellow Cleveland suburbanite]
spotted a very small mast on the horizon some distance to the south of our
track.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;At first I thought the mast belonged to one of the trawlers
we had been playing tag with all night, but as we approached it became apparent
that it belonged to a small sailboat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
this point I altered course to pass close aboard in order to hail the boat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;When the small size of the boat became obvious, I thought
it probably had been blown out to sea and no one would be aboard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Until this time no one had been seen in the
boat and now I decided to stop alongside and examine it in detail.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we approached within a few hundred yards,
it could be seen that the boat was riding to a sea anchor and was provided with
oars and other gear lying in the after section&#45;the forward area being decked
over and having a small cabin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I stopped <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span> with <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
about 10 yards abeam of the bridge, and we continued our examination.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although no on had been sighted on board, it
now was apparent that someone could very well be in the cabin.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mustering all the lung power of the bridge
watch and using a megaphone, we hailed the <i>Tinkerbelle</i> but to no avail.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It became obvious after a few minutes that if
there was in fact someone on board another means would have to be found to
rouse them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The solution to the problem was readily available.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I reached over and gave a long blast on the
ship&#39;s whistle, and there you were, leaping out of a small cabin as if you
thought you were about to be run down by the <i>Queen Mary</i> or some equally
large</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>ship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must now
admit that I found your reaction somewhat amusing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We exchanged greetings as you have already stated.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After you gave a negative response to my
offer of assistance, I was at a loss for words.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Since I had been delayed during the night and there was a good chance I
was going to be late arriving at my assigned station.  I proceeded on at best
speed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I came to the conclusion that you
were where you wanted to be and little could be gained by <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span>
remaining in your vicinity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I entered
your position (39° 46&#39; N, 66° 27&#39; W) and the name of your boat in the ship&#39;s
log in case the Coast Guard should start looking for you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I thought at the time that you most probably were a sailing
enthusiast on vacation and sailing to Halifax from Boston or some place in the Cape area.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am sincerely glad that I did not
know what your true destination was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
am sure that if I had known what you were attempting, I would have had a guilty
conscience on leaving you there.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I, too, am glad Lieutenant Commander Bacon was spared the
pain of a guilty conscience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
really was no reason for him to have had one, even if he had known where I was
bound, because, as he said in his letter, I was where I &#34;wanted to be&#34;; no one
had dropped me off there against my will.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And, since I was there of my own choice, I had won the right to
experience whatever that entailed, good or bad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So far it had been mostly very good and I was optimistic about the
future.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I have just one bone to pick with Captain Bacon:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>he called that noise he made with his
submarine a &#34;whistle.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How euphemistic
can you get?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ve called it a klaxon
sound, but even that falls pitifully short of being an adequate
description.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There simply is no word for
the sound the <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span> produced, a sound that
seemed to be a nerve-jangling synthesis of the wailing of banshees, the booming
of thunder and the screeching of all the demons of hell.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal><i>Tinkerbelle</i> spent the hours of darkness after our
meeting with the <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span> riding big
waves to her sea anchor while I tried as best I could to rest in her
cockpit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a chilly, wet,
miserable, dragged-out night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was
still too afraid of a capsize to seek shelter in the cabin when the waves were
ominously large, so I had to bear the discomforts of the cockpit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn&#39;t easy to sleep in that exposed,
perpetually joggling place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next morning (Wednesday, June 9<sup>th</sup>) the wind
continued to blow at twenty-five or thirty knots and my bleary eyes got their
first good look at the waves that, until then, had been partly hidden by the
mantle of night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some of them must have
been seventeen- or eighteen-footers, the biggest waves we&#39;d yet encountered.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I watched them in awe and was mightily
pleased and relieved to see how gracefully <i>Tinkerbelle</i> climbed to the
summit of each one in turn, glissaded into the valley beyond and then climbed
the next peak, on and on.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My little
craft performed her nautical functions with all the agility and stamina of a
ballet dancer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was delighted with her
and praised her to the skies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The threatening waves were not to be trifled with; I was
sure of that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was better to be wary
of them than wrecked by them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
equally true, though, that every minute we stayed tied to the sea anchor meant
another minute added to the duration of our voyage, and a lot of those extra
minutes could add up to one or more of several different crises that ought to
be avoided, if possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently, I
was eager to be moving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still, the waves held me transfixed with fright.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to envision what it would be like to
brave them under sail and the only pictures that came into my mind were of
disasters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did <span class=SpellE>Si</span>
<span class=SpellE>Lawlor</span> in his little <i>Sea Serpent</i> and William
Andrews in his collapsible <span class=SpellE><i>Sapolio</i></span> sail
through waves like these?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That they
might have done so seemed unbelievable, utterly fantastic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Yet <span class=SpellE>Lawlor</span> got
across the ocean in only forty-five days, an astounding accomplishment for a boat
only fifteen feet long.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Andrews, in a
boat half a foot shorter and with a greater distance to go, took eighty-four
days, but he couldn&#39;t have achieved even that mark if he had spent much time hitched to a sea anchor.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>I wrestled with fear through the whole morning as I studied
the waves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, in the early
afternoon, the conviction grew that we should get under way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;After all,&#34; I wrote in the log, &#34;The
whitecaps are small even though the waves are big.&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, marshaling all my courage, I decided to
put up one of the small jibs and proceed tentatively under it alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If conditions proved to be too hazardous, I&#39;d
get the sail down again immediately and go back to the sea anchor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I steeled my nerves and we started moving eastward once
more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sure that, even under just
the one small jib, we would take off like a jet-driven aquaplane.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I was wrong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We barely crawled.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had to hoist the <span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span>,
too, to get <i>Tinkerbelle</i> to move at a satisfactory pace.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(However, I&#39;m happy to be able to add that as
the voyage progressed my ability to size up sailing conditions improved.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I tried to get some pictures of Mother Carey&#39;s chickens
(storm petrels) the next afternoon, June 10<sup>th</sup>, but they moved so
fast it was extremely difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
were fascinating to watch, though, because of their odd habit of walking on the
water.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d never seen these birds
before, although I had crossed the Atlantic several times previously on ocean
liners.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The book Virginia
had given me said they were Wilson&#39;s
storm petrels, migrants from the Antarctic and the commonest members of the
storm petrel family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mother Carey, it
said, was a corruption of Mater Cara, an appellation of the Blessed Virgin
Mary, and storm petrel was derived from Saint Peter, who also walked on the
water, according to the Bible, until his lack of faith brought on a
ducking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Maoris of New Zealand had a
poetic term for the birds, &#34;<span class=SpellE><i>takahi</i></span><i> <span
class=SpellE>kare</span> <span class=SpellE>moana</span></i>,&#34; which meant
&#34;dancing on the waters.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought that
was a particularly apt description.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Wilson&#39;s bird
was a little smaller than a robin, brownish-gray and black, with a white spot
at the base of its tail.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes it
seemed to hop along on the water, sometimes it used its feet</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>like skis and sometimes it simply walked.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two or three times I was amused by a bird
that just stood on the water flapping its wings, as though it were trying to
pull its feet out of hardening cement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not once did I see Wilson&#39;s
storm petrels <i>in</i> the water, floating and resting like little water
birds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were always flying, beating
their wings without letup, moving erratically like butterflies and usually very
close to the water&#39;s surface.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They must
be tireless creatures, or else embarrassed to have anyone see them inactive.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bird book said they occasionally alighted
on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the water, but I never saw one do so, although I watched
them intermittently all the way across the ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One other variety of bird accompanied me almost all the way
to England, the
greater shearwater, a brown-and-white bird about twenty inches long, with a
wingspread of more than two feet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also
saw, occasionally, pretty black-and-white terns and of course, gulls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The greater shearwater was a lovely bird to watch in flight,
it rode the wind so elegantly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It,
unlike the storm petrel, was frequently to be seen bobbing on the water,
resting or feeding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, it never
accepted the tidbits I offered.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>One day I came upon an oceanic melodrama, a tragedy of the sea in which the innocent victims were little fishes,
probably herring, and the villains were giant tuna and ravenous
shearwaters.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The poor herring found
themselves in a terrible fix:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>if they
stayed in the water the tuna got them, and if they jumped out of the water in
their frantic efforts to escape the tuna followed right on their tails; besides
which, in the air or near the surface, the shearwaters got them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were trapped between two devils and the
deep blue sea:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>doomed, no matter what
they did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I watched this battle for survival with something
approaching horror-stricken fascination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The greedy tuna and shearwaters gorged themselves on the hapless
herring.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But as <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I
drew within twenty yards or so all the shearwaters in the area, alarmed at the
sight of us, took to their wings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All
except one, that is.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This particular
bird cut loose with a great squawking and flapping of wings, but, try as it
would, it couldn&#39;t get airborne.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
first I thought the squawks and the inability to fly meant it had been
injured&#45;by a tuna, perhaps&#45;and was in distress, so I headed toward it with the
intention of seeing if I could render first aid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, in a very short time it became clear
that the bird was simply cussing itself out in bird language for having eaten
so <span class=SpellE>piggishly</span> that it was now too heavy to take
off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, believe me, that bird knew how
to cuss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am no prig and yet I was
shocked!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And so were the tuna, for, as
the air turned blue, they left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we bore down on the bird, its cursing and <span
class=SpellE>wingbeats</span> became more frenzied.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, goaded by fear into making one last,
do-or-die, <span class=SpellE>superbird</span> effort, it flogged itself into
the air like an overloaded cargo plane and lumbered away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don&#39;t know bird language, so I can&#39;t say
for sure what it said as it fought for altitude, but the tone and inflection
sounded like &#34;Gee-hookers!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was a
close one!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after sunset I noticed the barometer was down a
tenth of an inch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That wasn&#39;t much of a
drop, but sure enough it began to blow hard and I had to stream the sea anchor
again.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Wow!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What a
night!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wrote in the log the next
morning (June 11<sup>th</sup>), &#34;I hope I don&#39;t have to go through any more
like that, but I probably will.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
cold, too, as the wind had shifted from west to north.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wind relaxed a little at about 12:30 P.M., however, and then the sun came out for the
first time in three days and we had a gloriously sunny, warm afternoon of
sailing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hove to contentedly in the
moonlight at about ten that night and, just before going below to sleep, saw a
big liner rumble westward a few miles north of us, its portholes agleam and its
decks bathed in soft light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next morning, I awoke at about sunrise after a full
seven hours of warm, relaxed sleep, and lay there in the cabin luxuriating in
the pleasure of being rocked gently by the waves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sounds of water had enchanted and soothed me
all my life:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the roar of a fast-flowing
stream in a valley of the Himalayas; the patter of monsoon rain on the tin roof
of our home in <span class=SpellE>Landour</span>; the crash and hiss of
breakers hitting the beach at Ventnor, New Jersey, where our family had thrice
vacationed; the slap and gurgle of Lake Erie fresh-water waves around the <span
class=SpellE>breakwall</span> at Wildwood Park harbor and now the happy
laughter of Atlantic saltwater billows as they toyed playfully with <i>Tinkerbelle</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Saturday, June 12<sup>th</sup>, and one of those
&#34;God&#39;s-in-His-heaven-all&#39;s-right-with-the-world&#34; mornings that come along every
once in a while to give you a taste of how wonderful life can be.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then, just as I was beginning to slip
into utter harmony with the delights of the environment, I became conscious of
a subtle something.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard nothing
whatever that could be termed alien or out of place and yet, gradually,
imperceptibly, I was infused with an eerie feeling that <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and
I were not alone, that we had company. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It was an uncanny sensation, as if I were on
the receiving end of a telepathic message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I opened the hatch and went topside.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Good Lord!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was another vessel!</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>This was much larger than the <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It towered above us, its tremendous bow jutting
higher than <i>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s masthead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was a Canadian naval vessel and to me, then only twenty-five yards
away, it seemed large enough to be a battleship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, I found out later it was a destroyer
escort, H.M.C.S. <i>Columbia</i>, a beautiful light-gray ship with a
well-cared-for look about it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the <i>Columbia</i>&#39;s
rail, when I emerged from the cabin, was an officer in a smart white
uniform.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had an electronic megaphone
in his hands and, when he saw me, he used it to project his voice across the
water between us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Good morning,&#34; he said cheerily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>His friendly tone and casual manner seemed to imply that the
sole mission assigned to the <i>Columbia</i> by Royal Canadian Navy Headquarters was to conduct a genteel wake-up service for
<span class=SpellE>singlehanded</span> Atlantic yachtsmen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Hi!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I yelled back,
attempting to sound just as casual and cheery as the naval person at the rail
above me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Are you all right?&#34; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Everything&#39;s AOK here!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I shouted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then I remembered what I had neglected to ask the captain of
the <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span> and added, &#34;But I&#39;d appreciate it if
you&#39;d give me a line on my position.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Will do.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we waited for the <i>Columbia</i>&#39;s
navigator to work out the position, the officer asked me where I had come from
and where I was bound and what my craft&#39;s name was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I yelled back the replies and asked him if he
would report <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and me to the Coast Guard in Boston and he said he would.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the position
report came.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were at 40° 17&#39;N and 63°
7&#39;W.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was great news!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It showed that my navigation was reasonably
accurate, for the position I had calculated was less than six miles from that
given by the <i>Columbia</i>&#39;s
navigator.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>It was a tremendous relief to find out that my sun shots and
calculations hadn&#39;t gone haywire; that, apparently, I had got the hang of it and could now rely on my sextant and
arithmetic to take <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and me where we wanted to go.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I grew confident that we actually would land
at Falmouth, England,
and not unexpectedly at some other port.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Smooth sailing to you,&#34; called the <i>Columbia</i>&#39;s
blithe officer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I yelled back,
&#34;Thanks!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Same to you!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then the big ship quietly pulled away stern first, turned
northward and moved off with an air of majesty, its red-and-white ensign
fluttering in the breeze.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the first
time since we&#39;d met, I looked about the ocean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were three other warships in sight and off to the west airplanes
were streaking through the sky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must
be mixed up in some naval maneuvers I said to myself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It turned out I was right, but at that moment
I didn&#39;t know how right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later I learned that <i>Columbia</i>,
commanded by Commander P. R. Hinton, was participating in Exercise Polestar as
a member of the NATO Matchmaker Squadron, which was composed of four ships, one
each from Great Britain, Holland, the United
  States and Canada.
<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The three other ships I&#39;d seen
undoubtedly were those of Britain,
Holland and the United States.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;On the morning of 12 June at 0615,&#34; Commander A. C. <span
class=SpellE>McMillin</span> of the Royal Canadian Navy wrote to me, &#34;<i>Columbia</i> was patrolling her station when ordered to investigate a small radar
contact.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This contact turned out to be
the <i>Tinkerbelle</i>, and at first sight it appeared to be derelict, as there
was no sign of life.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As <i>Columbia</i> came alongside <i>Tinkerbelle</i> you appeared and spoke to Sub-Lt. E. J.
Kelley, who was the officer-of-the-watch at the time.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I learned, too that Exercise Polestar was an antisubmarine
exercise in which units of the United States and Canadian Navies and the NATO
squadron were divided into teams and pitted against one another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, the <span class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span>
was a participant, but on the side opposite the <i>Columbia</i>,
as the &#34;enemy.&#34;</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>Meeting both &#34;friend&#34; and &#34;foe&#34; in a naval exercise was a
thrilling experience, one I shall remember always.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I feel mortified about the way <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I blundered
like bumpkins into those war games and diverted two vessels, for some minutes,
from their important assigned duties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Here and now I want to thank the officers and men of the <span
class=SpellE><i>Tench</i></span><i> </i>and <i>Columbia</i> for their solicitous concern for our safety and, humbly, beg the Navies of
Great Britain, Holland, the United
  States and Canada
to pardon our intrusion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next night, following our encounter with H.M.C.S. <i>Columbia</i>,
we had another beautiful, easygoing sail in the moonlight until about 11:45 P.M., when I turned in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Sunday, June 13<sup>th</sup>, I awoke to find a stiff
breeze blowing so I kept <i>Tinkerbelle</i> tethered to the bucket drogue and
utilized the time that gave me away from the tiller to rearrange the stowage of
my supplies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was getting more and more
fed up with having to root through nearly everything I had to find what I
wanted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also took the opportunity to
write some letters, to Virginia and others, which I hoped a passing ship might eventually pick up and mail for
me when it reached port.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were hove to
for seven or eight hours, altogether, not counting the night hours when I was
sleeping.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was quite a pleasant time,
on the whole, for the waves were not quite big enough to scare me out of the
comfort of the cabin, but I was impatient and fretful because we weren&#39;t moving
eastward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, we were falling
behind on the schedule I&#39;d set and if we didn&#39;t get cracking soon it would take
more than three months to reach England instead of the two months I had
estimated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fortunately, the wind abated a little at about one in the
afternoon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hauled in the sea anchor,
put a tuck in the <span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span> and the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i><span style='mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'> spread her red-and-white wings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We took off at top speed.</span></p>
