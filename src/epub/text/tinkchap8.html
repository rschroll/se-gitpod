<p class=MsoNormal>By mid morning the wind had fallen off sufficiently to
resume sailing safely, so I pulled in the sea anchor, <span class=SpellE>rehung</span>
the rudder at the stern and ran the sails aloft.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It felt good to be moving forward again, able
to steer instead of drifting stern first with scant maneuverability.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the brief storm we had drifted steadily, though
slowly, southwestward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sure my
dead reckoning was highly inaccurate, for any one of half a dozen good reasons,
but I wasn&#39;t especially worried about it because there was nothing but open sea
for hundreds and hundreds of miles to the southeast or east.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even to the northeast we had three hundred or
more miles of ocean between us and the coast of Nova Scotia and that graveyard of ships, Sable Island.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So why worry?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As long as we moved on a course between, say, 45° (NE) and 135° (SE), we
could keep on going for days, maybe even weeks, without any danger of running
against the land.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We really didn&#39;t have
to know exactly where we were for quite a few days yet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had a hunch, though, that we were many miles to the south
of the shipping lanes; in fact, I believed we were some miles south of the
parallel of 40° N latitude, which was roughly ten miles to the south of the
more southerly of the two main shipping lanes between New York and the English
Channel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t want to go any farther
south than this because it would add extra miles to our voyage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My plan was to sail more or less directly
eastward until we reached the meridian of 40° W.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This would take us to the south of most of
the foggy Grand Banks area and what the pilot chart
called the mean maximum iceberg limit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then, at 40° W, we would sail northeastward parallel to, but well away from, the great circle shipping
track between the Panama Canal and Bishop Rock in the <span
class=SpellE>Scilly</span> Isles, at the entrance to the English
 Channel.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal>If the voyage became too difficult, so filled with hardships
that I couldn&#39;t go on, I would make for Flores, in the Azores,
and either rest for a few days before continuing or end my trip there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a chart of the island to use in case
that became necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In my mind&#39;s eye I pictured the voyage as a tremendous
countdown in degrees of longitude from 71° W, the meridian at which we had
entered the open ocean near Martha&#39;s Vineyard, to 5° W,
the approximate meridian of Falmouth, England,
our destination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I viewed this huge
countdown as a series of ten-degree steps, except for the first one, which was
eleven degrees (71° W to 60° W), and the last one, which was only five degrees
(10° W to 5° W).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought it would be
useful, psychologically, if I divided my main objective of a transatlantic
voyage into this series of lesser goals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The first of these to aim for, then, was the meridian of 60° W; and
after that would come 50° W, 40° W, 30° W and so on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After we reached 40° W longitude, we would also begin a
single, ten-degree <span class=SpellE>countup</span> latitude, from 40° N, my
anticipated latitude at that time, to 50° N, the approximate latitude of
Falmouth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, I thought we had
better begin a short <span class=SpellE>countup</span> immediately because,
according to my hunch, we were some miles to the south of 40° N latitude.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently, when we started sailing, it was
on a course of 50°; that is, just a little eastward of true northeast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By this time I had gone without sleep for more than
forty-eight hours, except for the nap I&#39;d had in the cockpit the second day
out, and although I&#39;d been taking stay-awake pills to keep myself alert, my
body&#39;s desperate need for rest (ashore it had been used to a full eight hours&#39;
sleep every night) was becoming acute, unmistakable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or rather, it should have been unmistakable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Actually, I didn&#39;t recognize the symptoms immediately</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>because the pills I was taking contained a chemical mood
elevator that made me feel great even though I was on the borderline of
exhaustion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The symptoms were so
unexpectedly fantastic, so far removed from any previous experience, that I
didn&#39;t realize their import until many days later, after I&#39;d encountered them
once or twice more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lack of sleep may
not have been the sole cause; the pills themselves could have been partly to
blame.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But, whatever the cause, I
floated off in the early afternoon into a realm of wild fantasy, a strange
world of mixed illusion and reality such as I had never known before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I lived through an hours-long hallucination.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It proved an interesting subject for contemplation, after it
was all over, but while it was occurring it was most vexatious, decidedly
unpleasant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It made me waste a whole
afternoon sailing hither and yon about the ocean.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the incident was so unusual, so
completely different from any earlier happening in my life, that I have great
difficulty in describing it satisfactorily, especially for anyone who has not
had a similar experience.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I suppose, in
a sense, I went off the deep end, out of my mind, into a Never Land where real things and dream
things existed side by side without distinction; where reality and imagination
merged, leaving no hints of which was which.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I have attributed what took place to lack of sleep and stay-awake pills,
but anxiety and, even more likely, loneliness, as my mother had feared, may
have contributed to it, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like a person
in a hypnotic trance, I simply began seeing and hearing things that weren&#39;t
really there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I became aware, gradually, that I was not alone; someone a
man, was on <i>Tinkerbelle</i> with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This man had no face that I can recall; nor can I remember what he wore,
although his clothing seemed to be appropriate for sailing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was a quiet man with very little to say,
and he was friendly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At first I
reciprocated with equal friendliness, but later on his presence became
inexpressibly annoying, intolerable.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>It developed that he was on <i>Tinkerbelle</i> as a seagoing
hitchhiker and I was taking him to his home, which was on a small
island somewhere in our vicinity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Of
course, there really was no island in that part of the Atlantic.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But we had a terrible time finding the
place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We sailed this way, and that way,
and around, and back, and north, and south, and east, and west, trying to catch
sight of a scrap of treeless land with a couple of houses on it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometime during the afternoon I recalled the storm <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
and I had been through the night before and, fearful that we might be hit by a
southeast wind that would. batter </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>us toward a lee shore, I decided I should try out the storm
sails I&#39;d made of heavy canvas to see if they would enable us to beat away from
such a hazard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, my phantom
companion thought I should take him to his home before I spent any time
experimenting with the storm sails, and we got into a slight hassle about it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My arguments prevailed, though, for at sea
the skipper&#39;s word is law.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried out
the storm sails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I replaced the white <span class=SpellE>genoa</span> with a
minute jib and the red main with a small trysail.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The heavy-weather suit of canvas seemed to
fit the boat all right, but beyond that the tryout was a flop; there simply
wasn&#39;t enough wind to move the boat with such small sails.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only adequate tryout would be in a storm.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>So I reset the original sails and we continued our island
hunt, to the great satisfaction of the hitchhiker.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In fact, preposterous as it seems, my airy
chum took over the tiller and I became the passenger.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such is the remarkable stuff of
hallucinations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On we sailed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We never seemed to talk out loud; that is, we
seldom actually moved our lips, but we did converse in a miraculous, soundless
way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I kept pressing my shipmate for
descriptions of the island and for clues to the course to be sailed to reach
it, all the while straining my eyes to spot a bit of sand or rock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My companion then admitted that the island would be hard to
find because it rose only a few feet above the level of the sea and was mostly
rocky, the rocks being a blue that blended almost perfectly with the color of
the sea&#45;camouflage par excellence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Several times I thought I&#39;d spotted the island and cried out to the
phantom to steer in that direction, but when we drew closer it became evident
that what I&#39;d seen was merely rock-like wave forms.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was discouraging and irritating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This bloke I had on board was wasting my time
on a wild-goose chase.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I grew more and
more peevish, more and more impatiently eager to find his blasted rock pile and
put him on it so that I could continue on my way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had started out as a good Samaritan, but
now I was entirely disenchanted with that role.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I guess he sensed my rising exasperation because he kept
saying, &#34;It won&#39;t be much longer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just
be patient, we&#39;ll soon be there.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By early evening I was in a frenzy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m reluctant to own up to it because of what
it may indicate about my character, but I was ready to run amok and toss my
unwanted guest into the sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I
could resume my own hunt, for England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But at that very moment, in the nick of time,
he yelled, &#34;There it is!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There it
is!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, sure enough, there it was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw it too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a solid patch no bigger than a city block, and if it
was composed of anything besides sea-blue rocks I couldn&#39;t see what it
was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No sand was visible anywhere, and
no vegetation of any sort.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was
nothing but rock, rock, rock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the
two</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>small houses at the center of the island were made of the
same type of rock, which made it hard to distinguish between them and their
surroundings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About the only way you
could tell they were houses was by the windows and doors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people came out of one of them and waved to us and we
waved back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The hitchhiker (I never
learned his name, unfortunately) wanted to sail right up to the shore, but I
was determined not to risk <i>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s life on such foolishness.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Why, she&#39;d be battered into splinters!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, to be on the safe side, I took over the
steering again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We sailed around the island looking for a place to dock, but
there was no suitable place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Good
Lord!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now what?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was I going to have to put up with this guy
even longer?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d had about all the
delays I could take.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was on the point
of telling him to swim for it or else when, through the magic that exists only
in fantasies, he was suddenly ashore with his family, grinning and waving me on
my way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I waved back happily, delighted
to be rid of him at last, and without wasting another minute I resumed my original
course of 50°.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The daylight was waning
fast and I wanted to get as far away from that island as I could before turning
in for some badly needed sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except for the two-and-a-half-hour nap, I had now gone
without sleep for about fifty-five hours and I was drooping dangerously.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes open.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d force them open and they&#39;d stay open for
a time, but inevitably the eyelids would grow heavy and slowly close.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d go on sailing with closed eyes for a
little while and then a wave would jolt <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I&#39;d start to
keel over, all but dead to the world.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I&#39;d catch myself just in time to avoid cracking my skull on the deck or
rolling overboard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several times, in my
somnambulistic state, I put <i>Tinkerbelle</i> into an accidental jibe that
sent the boom zinging around with a murderous slash.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The spar itself hit me only once,
painfully.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But another time it drew the
mainsheet across the bridge of my nose, giving me a bad rope burn that took
many days to heal.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>It was perilous to continue while so near the edge of
complete exhaustion; I still had enough of my wits about me to realize
that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I simply had to have some rest; my
whole being cried out for it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, finally,
somehow, I put out the sea anchor, struck the sails, unshipped the rudder and
crawled into the cabin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Luckily, the sea
was fairly calm, making it safe to risk sleeping in the cabin; but even if it
hadn&#39;t been calm I think I would have slept there that night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I lay down on top of my supplies on the starboard side, pulled
the blanket over me and dropped into unconsciousness as if I&#39;d been dealt a
knockout blow.</p>
