<p class=MsoNormal>Even with shortened canvas <i>Tinkerbelle</i> rushed
headlong through the darkness at about seven knots, her top speed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her spray soaked sails strained against their
fastenings as the relentless wind probed for some point of weakness that could
be forced to give way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every now and
then a foaming wave cap slammed into her starboard side, sending up a geyser of
spume and sloshing rivers of salt water back along her deck, half filling her
self-bailing cockpit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Under each blow of
the waves she lurched like a wounded doe, dipping to leeward with a tense,
stomach-churning heave.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She told me
through her tiller, by the way she wanted to point closer to the wind, that she
was unhappy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I forced her to go on,
full tilt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What time was it?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How
many more grueling hours to dawn?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I wrapped the mainsheet once around the tiller and held both
in my left hand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, struggling to
keep <i>Tinkerbelle </i>on course with this hand, I shined a flashlight into
the cabin with my right hand and peered through the tiny porthole in the drop
panel of the battened-down hatch.  I&#39;d
hung a wristwatch inside where it was relatively dry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From the Greenwich mean time indicated by the
watch, I calculated it was roughly 2 A.M. at our meridian of longitude; 2 A.M. <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh, God.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another two and a half hours to sunrise!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d be frozen stiff by then.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not to mention blown silly or drowned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My teeth chattered even though I had on four layers of
clothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wore padded thermal long
johns next to my skin, regular cotton underwear over these, then a woolen shirt
and woolen trousers and, on top of everything, a yellow rubberized
anti-exposure suit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And still I
shivered.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p2">Page 2</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>My socks, canvas shoes, feet and the lower halves of my
trousers and legs were soaked despite the waterproof outer suit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Rivulets from my sodden hair trickled across
my face and down my neck, stabbing icily at my back, making me wince.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My hands were puckered and swollen from
prolonged saturation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They hurt,
especially the tips of the fingers and thumbs, which made untying knots and
adjusting the sheets painful tasks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Salt-water sores on my buttocks turned the necessity of sitting into
pure misery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The cabin barometer was an enigma.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wasn&#39;t sure what its strange behavior
presaged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>During the day it had fallen
gradually. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Then, between sunset and
about 11 P.M., it had held
steady.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But since eleven it had zipped
upward again at an alarming rate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
suspected it meant we&#39;d soon encounter even stronger winds than those we were
already battling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wind, whistling out of the south at twenty-five knots,
the most that <i>Tinkerbelle</i> could stand up to under reefed main, built up
menacing seas that threatened to bowl her over on her beam ends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She had to be swerved around periodically to
meet the biggest of the cross-waves almost head-on or she&#39d have got into
serious trouble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Yet we kept moving, despite our vulnerability, because I
wanted to make up for the seven or eight hours we&#39d spent hove to in a hard
blow during the day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would take
forever to reach England if we had to spend that many hours out of every twenty-four lying to a sea
anchor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were already several days
behind schedule.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So on we raced, taxing
our endurance to the limit, reeling off a fraction less than two nautical miles
every fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except for glimpses at ocean, sails and sky, I kept my eyes
fastened on the orange glow of the compass, shifting the tiller to right and
left as required to keep the index line opposite the mark for 105°, our
eastward course, printed on the swaying card.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We bucketed along, our position at that hour being approximately 40° 43'
N and 60° 50' W, which meant we were some two hundred and ninety </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>nautical miles south of Canada&#39;s
Cape Breton Island and four hundred and eighty miles east of Long Island. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was Monday, June 14<sup>th</sup>, and we were fourteen
days out from Falmouth, Massachusetts,
on the first leg of a transatlantic voyage I had dreamed of most of my life and
carefully planned for more than a year. </p>

<p>&#34;England, here we come!&#34; I yelled at the stars.</p>
