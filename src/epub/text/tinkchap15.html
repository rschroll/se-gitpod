<p class=MsoNormal>On Tuesday, July 13<sup>th</sup>, after nearly two days of
drifting to the sea anchor while working on the rudder, we started sailing
again and it soon became evident the repair job would hold up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rudder was now as strong as iron; I
expected no further trouble from it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That day and the next the weather was cloudy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then came July 15<sup>th</sup>, a wonderful,
sunny day, and my sextant sights revealed we had passed 37° W, the halfway
mark.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That evening I celebrated the
occasion by eating, with delicious hard-sauce topping, the plum pudding I had
brought along for that specific purpose.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I felt we were getting somewhere at last.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would be a downhill run the rest of the
way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But there was a tinge of sadness in this fact, too, for it
meant the voyage was now middle-aged, moving closer and closer to old age and,
after that, &#34;death.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d
want it to go on forever, yet, whether I did or not, its end, no matter how
happy or how longed for, would be accompanied by sharp twinges of pain, an
undercurrent of profound regret.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
then the voyage&#45;and all it meant to me in happiness&#45;would have moved from
anticipation through realization into the past, where events, once lodged,
existed only in the limbo of memory and could not (no matter how hard we tried)
be relived.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I consoled myself with the
thought that there would be other challenges to face, other dreams to fulfill,
even though none in the future could compare with this one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When darkness descended on us, a fairly gentle southwest
breeze was blowing, so I decided to wing out the small twin jibs for
self-steering and let <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle </i>continue
moving eastward</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p157">Page 157</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>taking care of herself, while I slept.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The small jibs didn&#39;t perform quite as well
as the twin <span class=SpellE>gennies</span> had, since their smaller area
meant less force exerted on the tiller and less responsiveness to changing
conditions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They allowed the boat to
weave from side to side somewhat, but nevertheless kept her headed in a
generally eastward direction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I managed
to get six hours of sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the
possibility that the wind might increase dangerously while I slept made me so
nervous I never again tried the self-steering stunt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t even try it during the day, when I
was awake because the twin jibs were so small they couldn&#39;t keep <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> moving at her best.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Between noon,
Saturday, July 17<sup>th</sup>, and noon the next day, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> made her
best day&#39;s run of the entire voyage:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>eighty-seven miles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To achieve
that mark I had kept her going all night, but it was worth it, for it made the
step from 40° W to 30° W the briefest of the whole countdown:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>only nine days.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In comparison, the first step, from 71° W to
60° W, had taken sixteen days; the second step, to 50° W, had taken twelve
days, and the third step, to 40° W, had taken thirteen days.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(The next two
 ten-degree steps in the countdown were to take, in succession,
eleven days and twelve days.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By July 18<sup>th</sup>,
too, we had moved along more than four degrees in the ten-degree <span
class=SpellE>countup</span> from 40° N to 50° N.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Three days later, in the early afternoon of Wednesday, July
21<sup>st</sup>, we were becalmed for several hours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I lowered the sails, secured the boom in the
boom crutch and sat in the cockpit, leaning back against the aft end of the
cabin, resting and thinking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ocean in
a dead calm must be the quietest place on earth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not a sound was to be heard except that of my
own breathing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were no birds to be
seen or heard, and no chuckling of ripples.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The ocean was flat and round like a gigantic blue coin, and it was as silent
as a motionless penny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The scene was
eerie and yet so peaceful, so soothing, so soul-refreshing.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p158">Page 158</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>I reveled in it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
seemed almost as though I had achieved the blessings of the Buddhist&#39;s nirvana,
the Moslem&#39;s paradise and the Christian&#39;s heaven without having gone through
the qualifying preliminary travail.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
was fortunate indeed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At about five o-clock a westerly breeze started to blow, and
the sea&#39;s surface stirred as if it were a counterpane on the bed of a sleeping
giant.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t feel the breeze right
away; I heard it first, or rather, I heard the breaking wavelets it
caused.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the little breakers
approached to within half a mile (or maybe it was closer than that), they
sounded&#45;amid that vast stillness&#45;like lions roaring.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My ears made them seem frightening, but my
eyes told me they weren&#39;t worth worrying about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon the breeze reached us and with it the midget
breakers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The usual sounds of the sea
resumed; the chuckling, gurgling, sloshing, hissing, bubbling that had grown so
familiar in the weeks since we had slipped out of Vineyard Sound.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hoisted the sails and we got under way
again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Observed from the high deck of a liner, the sea had seemed
rather drab and monotonous; nothing but unbroken stretches of water and sky
divided by the horizon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But on board <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>, down close to the water,
the sea became immensely more interesting; first, because of the seemingly
infinite variety of wind, wave and sky combinations, and, second, because down
low it was easy to see things in and on the water that could seldom be seen by
anyone from a fast-moving ship.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The waves, of course, were formed by the wind; and their
size depended on the force of the wind, the length of time it had been blowing
in a given direction and the distance it had traveled over the sea during that
time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A moderate westerly wind blowing
for, say, four hours over a hundred miles of ocean might start six-foot waves
marching eastward.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This, for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>, meant a relatively
uncomplicated run before the wind; enlivened, perhaps, by some surfboarding
down the forward slopes of the waves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Good enough.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But now imagine the
wind backing forty-five degrees into the southwest and starting</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p159">Page 159</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>other waves marching northeastward.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This sort of change occurred frequently and
kept things from getting dull, since the two different sets of waves
periodically got into step, reinforcing one another and producing waves
considerably bigger than those that came before or after.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was why, so often, bigger-than-average
waves came in definite cycles, with smaller waves in between.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, gradually, as the original waves lost
their energy and subsided into swells, the newer waves grew and, if the wind
continued blowing from the same direction long enough, erased all traces of the
earlier waves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But this was just the beginning of the possible
variations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes eastward-moving
waves met platoons of northward-moving cross-waves or even northwestward-moving
waves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes a gentle northwesterly
breeze pushed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> northeastward
while the waves, marching out of the southeast, moved directly against the
breeze.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes the swells moved in
one direction, the waves in another and the wind in still another.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And once, unforgettably, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> was becalmed in the midst of rows of steep swells
moving south while other equally steep swells moved north.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As these opposing ranks of swells met, they
shot up into sharp peaks that made our presence among them interesting, to say
the least.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On another occasion <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
was ghosting along before a very light westerly breeze, against big swells
coming toward her from the east.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each
swell was so big that it pushed a great mass of air in front of it, creating a
breeze in opposition to the light westerly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And that produced a maddening afternoon of sailing for me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s
<span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span> was swung out to starboard to catch the light
westerly, but when a swell came along the breeze it made <span class=SpellE>backwinded</span>
the sail and sent the boom back out to starboard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then, of course, along came another swell
with another counter-breeze to shoot the boom at my head again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It went on like that for four or five hours,
during which</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p160">Page 160</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>I got a number of nasty knocks on the noggin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was no need to worry about <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s relationship to the waves as long as there were no
breaking crests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the waves grew, they
broke, first, in a gentle, sliding manner which allowed the foam of the crests
to remain on the rear slops of the waves; but then, as they grew bigger still,
they broke with a definite curling forward which made the crests fall and
thunder down the front surfaces of the waves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When the waves began to break in this forward-curling way, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> had to watch her step.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And when the breakers got too big to sail
among safely&#45;usually when the wind was blowing at thirty-five knots or more&#45;she
had to be tethered to her bucket drogue to keep her headed straight toward
them, so as to take them bow on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The waves we encountered always seemed to be perfectly
straightforward creations of the wind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even the complicated patterns of waves, cross-waves and
counter-cross-waves were born of the wind, and the steps in their genesis
usually could be deduced from observation of their behavior.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We never, that I know of, encountered &#34;freak&#34;
or tidal waves one hears about occasionally, which are caused by undersea
earthquakes or similar disturbances; but we did meet, fairly frequently, a
peculiar type of wave that differed markedly from its fellows in
deportment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We&#39;d be moving along at a
brisk pace, minding our own business (I, paying no attention whatever to the
waves which were approaching, say, from the starboard quarter), when all of a
sudden a chunk of frothing wave top the size of four basketballs would break
off from a whitecap and come charging diagonally across the established path of
the waves and give <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> an
impudent swat on her behind as though chastising her for some sort of
misconduct.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or maybe they were love
pats; I never did really decide which.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle </i>got a lot
of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides the variations produced by winds and waves, the
expressions of the sea&#39;s face were constantly being altered by changes in the
sky.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the sky was an inverted bowl
of translucent</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p161">Page 161</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>blue, unblemished by a single cloud, the sea, too, was a
brilliant blue; deep, rich, so saturated with azure pigmentation it seemed as though <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s white hull would be
stained.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the other extreme, when the
sky was blotted out by gray clouds, the sea also was gray, gloomy,
foreboding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were numberless
variations between these extremes, of course, and the clouds
themselves&#45;cumulus, stratus, <span class=SpellE>cumulo</span>-nimbus,
alto-cumulus and cirrus, varying in shape, extent and degrees of darkness&#45;added
a whole new set of possible combinations to keep the sea environment from
becoming dull.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No two days were exactly
the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sometimes cumulus clouds lay in banks right on the surface
of the ocean, making it look as if they marked a nearby shoreline.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At other times they spaced themselves in tiny
clumps that made the sky look as if it were polka-dotted with cotton
balls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And at still other times they
grouped themselves in huge, miles-long canopies that took hours to pass
by.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember one of these gigantic
canopies that passed overhead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle </i>and I had been sailing under
it all day and then, shortly before sunset, I looked back and there was its end
a few miles astern, with clear, blue sky beyond.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was delightful to watch the sharp,
trailing edge of that cloud blanket pass over us and move on ahead, leaving us
under a cobalt dome with golden sunlight cavorting on a pathway to the
west.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was like coming out of a cave
into the daylight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Objects I saw in and on the sea also helped to keep the trip
from becoming tedious.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw whale,
dolphin, dorado, sharks, tuna, storm petrels, shearwaters, terns, flying fish,
gulfweed and a sea worm, which I have already mentioned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In addition, I saw odd, translucent things
drifting through the water, just below the surface, some of them rectangular,
like shoe boxes, but about half that size.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Each one of these had a bright orange patch on one side that, I guessed,
could <span class=SpellE>luminesce</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And I saw countless Portuguese men-of-war.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p162">Page 162</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>I began seeing the Portuguese men-of-war as soon as we got into the Gulf Stream and kept on
seeing them almost all the way across the ocean, although the nearer we got to England the
smaller and scarcer they became.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They
were most numerous in the area between 40° W and 20° W.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While in this part of the ocean, I amused
myself one afternoon by counting those I met; I spotted thirty in half an
hour.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since I saw one a minute in the
narrow strip of sea through which we were traveling, the total number must have
been fantastically large, probably well into the millions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Portuguese man-of-war is a strange-looking creature
(some experts say it is three creatures) with a transparent, elongated balloon
float, surmounted by a sail-like crest, showing above water; and with long,
evil-looking tentacles dangling below it, sometimes to a depth of three or more
feet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The floats of a few I saw were
almost colorless, but most of them were pale blue, and some of these blue ones
had violet-tinted sails.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were
pretty but, as I found out, painful.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I awoke one morning to find a Portuguese man-of-war entangled
in a jib sheet that had been trailing in the water through the night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I pulled the sheet on board, some of the
man-of-war&#39;s tentacles clung to it, without my knowledge, and I touched them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They caused a pain very much like a bee sting
and soon red welts appeared on my fingers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I had read that anyone heavily stung by a man-of-war would be lucky to
survive and, after having suffered one small sting, I could well believe
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I henceforth made sure trailing
sheets were free of tentacles before I handled them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once we were moving slowly before a gentle breeze and I
noticed that many of the Portuguese men-of-war we passed had small fish, five
or six inches long, hovering under them and that some of these fish left the
men-of-war and took up new positions under <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before the day was out, my craft had a troop
of more than a dozen fish accompanying her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I suppose they felt <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s
red bottom would scare off bigger fish that might otherwise be tempted to
gobble them up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was glad</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p163">Page 163</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>to let <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
watch over them as long as the breeze was gentle and we couldn&#39;t go any faster,
but the next day the wind picked up and we had to leave the little fish
behind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I imagine they found other
men-of-war with which to hobnob.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Besides living things, there were interesting inanimate
objects to see in mid-ocean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>An empty
fifty-gallon oil drum sped</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>by one day before a strong southeasterly wind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also saw drifting mooring buoys, gasoline
cans, glass fish-net floats, and planks, beams and tree trunks of varying
sizes, all heavily encrusted with gooseneck barnacles.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I came across pieces of orange-red fish net,
too, the same sort of net I saw later on trawlers in England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the most surprising non-living thing I
bumped into was an electric light bulb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was bobbing through the waves, buoyant as you please, untroubled by
the breakers and seemingly capable of continuing indefinitely.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only the Lord knew how long it had been
afloat and how many storms it had survived, but I&#39;ll wager it had been through
more than one.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p164">Page 164</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Well, I thought, that ought to prove something about the strength and safety of small boats too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While I was still becalmed on July 21<sup>st</sup>, I saw
three ships, two of them at the same time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was the first time I&#39;d had more than one ship in sight since June 6<sup>th</sup>
when I had seen the Russian trawlers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&#34;Made the spot seem like Times Square,&#34; I wrote
in the log.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the ships came up over the eastern horizon headed
straight for us, moving at full speed on an unwavering course.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was beginning to think it didn&#39;t see us and
that I had better dive into the water and swim for my life when it finally
swerved off to port and passed with no more than twenty-five yards&#39; clearance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had a hammer and sickle emblem on its funnel,
so it was Russian; and on the stern was its name, <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Neptun</i></span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There wasn&#39;t a single person to be seen on
deck, but just after it passed, someone, possibly the captain, came out on the
port wing of the bridge and studied us through binoculars.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d have given more than a penny for his
thoughts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the ship disappeared over
the western horizon as speedily as it had approached the east.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That night I was sailing along happily when suddenly I saw a
phosphorescent streak in the water headed directly toward <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Startled out of
my wits, I thought, <span class=SpellE>Lummy</span>!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We&#39;re being torpedoed!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But almost at once, of course, I realized
that was ridiculous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nevertheless, I
half shut my eyes and held my breath, bracing myself for the impact of whatever
it was against the boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But none
came.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few seconds later I heard a
peculiar popping and the sound of air being expelled.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That gave the show away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The torpedo was a dolphin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Several other times, later on, I saw these luminous streaks
in the water and they never failed to excite me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Dolphin visited us frequently, both day and
night, but they never stayed with us long.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I think their longest visit lasted all of thirty seconds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
was just too slow to be interesting to dolphins, so they&#39;d swim circles around
her for a few seconds and then off they&#39;d race about their own high-speed
affairs.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p165">Page 165</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>The wind was so strong all day Thursday, July 22<sup>nd</sup>,
that I kept the boat hitched to the sea anchor while I remained snug inside the
cabin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I relaxed, did a few maintenance
jobs and listened to the radio.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
addition to the B.B.C. and the other stations I&#39;ve already mentioned, I began
to get a station in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Lisbon, Portugal,
regularly, and a delightful place in Holland that called itself &#34;The Happy Station.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Friday (July 23<sup>rd</sup>) the wind was still blowing
hard and I was sure many of the waves were twenty&#45;footers, equal to the largest
waves we had met, but we started sailing anyway because I was determined to
reach Falmouth, if I possibly
could, by August 15<sup>th</sup>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
wet going; I was soaked from the waist down, in spite of the anti-exposure suit
I wore, but nothing untoward happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were no knockdowns or other crises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The weather was cloudy, with scattered rain squalls to
contend with, but nothing more serious than that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember I felt extremely pleased with <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and with myself when we
managed to maneuver between two squalls, thus avoiding the rain they were
dropping onto the sea.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The twenty-fourth was a beautiful, sunny day, with fluffy
white clouds in the sky and a breeze of just the right strength.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p166">Page 166</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then on the twenty-fifth the weather about-faced, as it did
so often during the voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here&#39;s what
I put into the log:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Overslept just a bit this morning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Didn&#39;t hear the alarm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s now 6 A.M.<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The wind and waves seem O.K. for sailing, but it&#39;s a
dismal, cloudy day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Barometer&#39;s up,
though.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The weather sure has pulled a
switch.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just before sunset the sky cleared and that evening I logged
this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Soon after it cleared, the wind died out for a bit, then
shifted to the west for about an hour, still very light.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then it shifted to the southwest, closer to
south than west, and picked up in force.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The sky stayed clear most of the night and it was very pleasant
sailing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The wind was just right, strong
enough to move us at a good rate, but not so strong as to make me nervous.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I spent almost all night listening to the
B.B.C.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard a fine discussion on
acting by Noel Coward, a moving essay (with sound effects) on the season in Britain,
news, music and commentaries.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the first half of the voyage I hadn&#39;t used the radio
for much besides getting the time signals since I didn&#39;t want to exhaust the
batteries too swiftly (although I carried three sets of spare batteries).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But in the second half of the trip, when I
found the batteries were holding up extremely well, I spent many hours
listening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sound of voices helped to
soften the aches of loneliness that occasionally wrenched my inner being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>July 26<sup>th</sup> (Monday) was a cloudy, gloomy day and
at about 2 P.M. the wind grew so
strong we had to heave to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next day
started out even worse, for in addition to being cloudy the wind had shifted to
northeast, exactly the direction in which I wanted to go.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We&#39;d have to beat against it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The day began cold, cloudy and miserable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m afraid I was quite depressed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It got very foggy later on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I forced myself to pull in the sea anchor and get going.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p167">Page 167</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;And then, about 9 or 10 A.M. (T.T.), a remarkable thing happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All the fog
and clouds disappeared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and I had a day of restful,
easy sailing under a blue sky and on a blue ocean.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Took the opportunity to dry clothes and towels.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My spirits rose again to normal and above.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This type of mood change occurred about half a dozen times
during the journey.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cloudy and adverse
weather, or other setbacks, would get me into a state of melancholy and then, just
as my spirits hit bottom, along would come a magnificent, sunny day of fine
sailing that made me the happiest, luckiest man alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>July 28<sup>th</sup> (Wednesday) was memorable for three
events.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I described the first of these
in the log like this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;This has been quite a day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Started sailing with just the jib because the following waves were
pretty big and the wind quite strong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But I didn&#39;t get much speed with just the jib, so I decided to add the
reefed <span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That was a mistake, under the conditions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We started surfing down the forward slopes of
the bigger waves and then, while doing this, we broached and I got knocked
overboard for the sixth time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;That wasn&#39;t so bad.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I climbed back on board very quickly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But when I went over I was holding the tiller and the &#39;axle&#39; part of the
rudder fitting was badly bent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>[I held
fast to the tiller because I wasn&#39;t wearing a lifeline and didn&#39;t want to risk
being separated from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.]<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Luckily, though, I had brought along a spare
&#39;axle&#39; and I put it into place without the loss of time.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second memorable incident occurred immediately after the
rudder had been repaired, before we got under way again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m embarrassed to admit it, but in the
interests of making this an absolutely true account of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s voyage I&#39;d better do so.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The painful fact is that while I was moving
about the deck, preparing to resume sailing, I lost my balance and simply fell
overboard with a great splash.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I came to
the surface, furious at myself for being so clumsy, but by then, of course, it
was too late.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p168">Page 168</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>The third big event of the day was recorded thus in the log:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I was breezing along between 23° W and 22° W in the late
afternoon and happened to look back and there was a big freighter hot on my
heels.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the S.S. <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bischofstor</i></span> off Bremen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I waved as it passed and got a lot of waves back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone inquired if I was all right and I
assured him I was.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ship didn&#39;t stop, as I was in no need of assistance, and
soon was out of sight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was thankful
that it hadn&#39;t passed by any earlier, for it might then have witnessed my
ignominious fall into the sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
clothes were still sopping when it went by.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>An hour or so later, when I stopped for dinner and the evening sun shot,
I got into relatively dry clothes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some weeks after the voyage was completed, I got the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bischofstor</i>&#39;s</span>
side of the story of our meeting in a letter from <span class=SpellE>Lothar</span>
<span class=SpellE>Steinhoff</span>, third mate of the 8,487-ton vessel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We had been at sea for 11 days, coming from Tampa,
 Florida, and bound for Rotterdam
with 11,000 tons of phosphate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the
crew and passengers of the ship the 28<sup>th</sup>
 of July, 1965 will be unforgettable.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sky was overcast and poor visibility made
navigation very difficult.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>According to
our logbook, the sea was smooth; we noted veering westerly winds of Force
2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A sharp lookout was necessary because
of the misty weather.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<span class=SpellE>At about</span> 1800 GMT [Greenwich mean
time] the visibility became better.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
1830 GMT a very small object was sighted on our portside.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It looked like a buoy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our true course was 75° and the estimated
position 47° 14&#39; N, 22° 37&#39; W.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Capt. [Wilhelm] Beck altered course to approach as near as
possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some minutes later at about
1840 GMT we were surprised to make out a small red sail, which we thought must
belong to a lifeboat; so we got ready to save shipwrecked persons.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But then we noticed it wasn&#39;t a lifeboat, but
a very small sailboat, with what was probably a one-man crew.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was certainly a memorable occasion for us.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p169">Page 169</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Capt. Beck asked the lonely man if he needed help.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With gestures he indicated to us that all was well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we continued our voyage, and at 1913 GMT
we notified <span class=SpellE>Portishead</span> Radio [in England]
of the sighting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> was
about seven hundred and fifty miles off Land&#39;s End, the
westernmost tip of England,
when she met the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Bischofstor</i></span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two-thirds of her voyage was behind her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before much longer it would be over.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The very next day, July 29<sup>th</sup>, we met another
ship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is how its master, Captain
Olav <span class=SpellE>Viken</span>, described the meeting in a letter to me:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Our meeting was at 47° 30&#39; N, 22° 00&#39; W.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;When I saw your boat I thought it must be a lifeboat, so we
changed our course about 90° to see if assistance was needed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we found out that you needed no help I
wired <span class=SpellE>Rogaland</span> Radio about our meeting and it said it
would ask other ships in the area to keep an eye open for you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was our duty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We were on a voyage from Liverpool to Hamilton, Bermuda,
and Nassau, in the Great Bahamas,
with a general cargo.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Captain <span class=SpellE>Viken&#39;s</span> ship was the
9,350-ton M.S. <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Vardal</i></span>
of Haugesund, Norway.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It passed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
to starboard, going southwest.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought
it had disappeared over the horizon, but a little later I looked around and
there it was steaming directly toward us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It had finally spotted us and had doubled back on its course to make
sure I was O.K.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I appreciated what he
did, and what Captain Beck of the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Bischofstor</i></span> did, more than I can say, for it meant loss of
valuable time for both of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two days later I wrote in the log:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Seems like every time my morale sags sharply and I begin to
feel I&#39;ve &#39;had it&#39; a good day comes along to put me on my feet again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Today [Saturday, July 31<sup>st</sup>] was
such a day.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We had a marvelous sail and, to make this last day of our
second month at sea even better, we passed to the east of the </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p170">Page 170</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>meridian of 20° W, completing another stride in the
countdown to England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Falmouth was only fifteen degrees away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had hoped to continue sailing all that night, but at about
1 A.M., Sunday, August 1<sup>st</sup>,
a thunderstorm hit us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I streamed the
drogue and, buttoning <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> up
tight, got into the cabin out of the blustery, wet weather.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All that day and through the night we
remained parked to the drogue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
comfortable enough inside, away from the wind and rain, but it was
nerve-wracking to have to stay put when I wanted so much to be moving and end
our long voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the whitecaps that
slapped the boat every now and then didn&#39;t add to my peace of mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To help pass the time I decided to launch a bottle with a
note inside, just for the fun of seeing if anyone found it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wrote this message:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;To the finder:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
bottle is being released in the Atlantic Ocean at about 48° 30&#39; N, 19° 10&#39; W on
Aug. 1, 1965.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;If you will send this message with your name and address
&#45;with information on where you found the bottle and when&#45;to Robert Manry, 31003
<span class=SpellE>Royalview</span> Drive, <span class=SpellE>Willowick</span>,
Ohio, U.S.A.&#45;he will send you &#36;5 to compensate you for the trouble.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you.&#39;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I put the message in an empty plastic bottle that had
contained part of my supply of drinking water, screwed on the cap and tossed it
into the ocean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It floated so high in
the water that the northwest wind got a good grip on it and blew it rapidly
into the southeast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was soon out of
sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Two months later, after completing the voyage, I was back at
my home in Willowick and had forgotten all about the message and bottle, when a letter came from <span
class=SpellE>Franciso</span> Maria <span class=SpellE>Baleizao</span>, a
resident of a suburban town near Lisbon, Portugal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The letter, in difficult English, said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Dear Sir:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I find
your message on 25<sup>th</sup> September at three o&#39;clock P.M. in Praia Beach, Sintra, Portugal.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wait, then you send me &#36;5 to
compensate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank you.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My message, tattered now, apparently from the beating it
received as the bottle in which it traveled rolled over and</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p171">Page 171</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>over on its way to Portugal,
was enclosed with Mr. <span class=SpellE>Baleizao&#39;s</span> letter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was surprised and delighted to receive
both.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The five dollars I had promised
and a ten-dollar bonus were on their way to him in short order, and in a
subsequent letter, written in Portuguese, he told me a little about himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I was born in a picturesque village of Baixo <span class=SpellE>Alentejuo</span> called <span class=SpellE>Moura</span>, on March 27, 1925,&#34; he wrote.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;I resided there until the age of twenty, but
because of poverty of the area I moved into surroundings of Lisbon,
where I have been for the last twenty years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am a mason by profession.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am
married and my wife&#39;s name is <span class=SpellE>Gracinda</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pechoso</span> <span class=SpellE>Baleizao</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I like all sports, but like bicycle racing
the best.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, I practice none of
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My parents lived in the Hawaiian
 Islands close to seven years.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was pleased that my message was found, but especially
pleased that it was found by a man who apparently could use the token reward I
offered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was happy, too, that it was
found by a Portuguese because some of the world&#39;s greatest seamen have come
from Portugal:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Prince Henry the
Navigator, the stern bachelor who, although he never sailed himself, founded
Europe&#39;s first school of navigation and sponsored numerous voyages of
discovery; Bartholomew D&#237;az, discoverer of the Cape of Good Hope; Vasco <span
class=SpellE>da</span> <span class=SpellE>Gama</span>, who, following on D&#237;az&#39;s
heels, reached the riches of India, and, naturally, Ferdinand Magellan, whose
fleet was the first to circle the globe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the evening on Friday, August 6<sup>th</sup>, six days
after releasing the bottled note, I wrote in the log:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;This was a nice sailing day&#45;sunny, with fluffy clouds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can hardly believe I&#39;m getting all this
good weather.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s quite a switch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Hope it continues.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We&#39;re about halfway to 14° W (it&#39;s now 6 P.M. T.T.).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ve just finished a huge supper of curried
turkey and peas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ll go on sailing
until it starts getting dark.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I&#39;ll
size things up and decide whether to stop for sleep or go on all night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This good weather should be used to the
fullest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I hadn&#39;t seen a ship for days and, of course, thought I was</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p172">Page 172</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>miles from the shipping lanes, which I was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But about 5
 P.M. I began hearing a sound that I at first thought was a
plane.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I looked around and saw it
was a ship, almost on top of me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
Italian, the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sirio</i></span>
of Palermo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;It went by awfully close and fast.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was afraid the bow and stern waves might
tip us over, but we rode them all right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The crew at the rail gave us a hearty cheer and, as usual, snapped our
picture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I continued all night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Saw about five more ships.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They&#39;re getting thick.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Later I heard from <span class=SpellE>Livio</span> de <span
class=SpellE>Manzolini</span>, master of the M.S. <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sirio</i></span>, which was bound for London from Vera Cruz, Mexico.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wrote, in part:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;At 1630 hours [on August 6<sup>th</sup>] we met your boat
in latitude 49° 12&#39; N and longitude 14° 16&#39; W.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You didn&#39;t notice our vessel approaching, but when we got
close you turned around and saw us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
when we drew abreast of you, you waved to us as if an encounter such as ours
was perfectly normal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;When I saw that you didn&#39;t need help, I continued my course
supposing that you were one of those men who are compelled to cross the Atlantic
 Ocean alone.  I telegraphed the English Coast Guard your position.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My thanks to Captain <span class=SpellE>Manzolini</span> for
reporting my position and for his kind concern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On Sunday, August 8<sup>th</sup>, two days after our meeting
with the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sirio</i></span>,
we met another ship, the 556-foot, 18,000-ton tanker <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> Glory</i> of Antwerp,
probably the largest ship we spoke to on the whole voyage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And the meeting was one of the most
memorable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The big ship, skippered by Captain Emile J.A. <span
class=SpellE>Sart</span>, was on its way from Port Arthur, Texas, to London,
when it overtook <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> at 1230
GMT at 49° 30&#39;N and 12° 45&#39; W, about three hundred miles west of the English
coast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Captain <span class=SpellE>Sart</span>,
an extremely friendly man with a wonderfully jovial face, stopped</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p173">Page 173</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>his vessel and hailed me through an electronic megaphone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Are you an American?&#34; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Yes.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;What is your name?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;My name is Robert Manry, M-A-N-R-Y.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ve come from Massachusetts.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Where are you bound?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Falmouth, England.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The captain said he heard on a B.B.C. news program the day
before that planes of the Royal Air Force had been searching for me, but I
couldn&#39;t believe that was true because, according to the voyage plan I had
filed with both the American and the English Coast Guards, I wouldn&#39;t be
considered overdue until after August 15<sup>th</sup>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So I&#39;m sorry to say I disagreed with the
captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re looking for me,&#34; I said .<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;They may be looking for another man who left
Florida in a twelve-foot boat a
week before I left Massachusetts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was headed for Ireland.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was referring to Captain William Verity, master of the
diminutive <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Nonoalco</i></span>
(a Mayan word meaning &#34;mute ones&#34; or &#34;those who don&#39;t speak our tongue&#34;), who
had hoped his voyage would help to prove that Irish monks came to North and
South America in the fifth and sixth centuries.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I found out later that Captain Verity had been plagued by bad luck and
had had to abandon his projected cruise, at least for the time being.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Do you need any provisions?&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Captain <span class=SpellE>Sart</span> called
across the ten yards of water between us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;No, I really don&#39;t need anything,&#34; I shouted back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I could see he already had food there on
deck and might be disappointed if I refused to take it, so I added, &#34;But I sure
could use some fresh fruit.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The food was sealed in plastic bags and these were then secured
in a larger canvas bag, which, in turn, was tied into a life jacket to keep it
afloat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One end of a heaving line was
thrown to me and the other end was tied to the food parcel,</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p174">Page 174</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>which was then lowered into the ocean.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I soon had it aboard and was inspecting its
contents.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Captain <span class=SpellE>Sart</span>
had given me a banquet, the entrée of which was still hot from the oven:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a whole roast chicken and potato croquettes (<span
class=SpellE>Poulet</span> <span class=SpellE>Roti</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Pommes</span> Croquettes from the ship&#39;s officers&#39; Sunday
menu).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bag also contained a huge
loaf of freshly baked bread, apples, plums, lemons, a pound of Dutch butter, a
huge slab of chocolate with nuts in it, two cans of soft drink and two bottles
of beer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had to eat the chicken and the potato right away because
there was no refrigeration on <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And what a meal it was!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was more stuffed than the turkey at our
family&#39;s last Thanksgiving dinner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was extremely generous of the captain to give me all that food, I appreciated
it immensely, but I couldn&#39;t help worrying that maybe one of the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Glory</i>&#39;s officers didn&#39;t get enough to
eat at dinner that day because of the captain&#39;s kindness to me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sincerely hope not.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Even with its engines stopped, the tanker moved too fast for
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and soon was beyond
shouting range.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So it circled around and
moved by again, and, after that, two more times; and each time it passed we got
in a little more conversation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Captain <span
class=SpellE>Sart</span> was extremely considerate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Is everything all right?&#34; he asked again as his ship passed
by the fourth time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;Do you need
anything more?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;No, I&#39;m fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thank
you very much,&#34; I said.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;Thanks for the
marvelous banquet.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Glory</i>, chivalrous ship that it was,
dipped its flag in salute as it returned to its eastward course, and then it
gave <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and me a salute of
three blasts on its deep steam whistle.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I had no flag flying with which to return the dip, unfortunately, but I
was able to return the big ship&#39;s whistle blasts with my small gas-operated
foghorn.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I let loose three gas screams
that made the hair on my head vibrate but which, to those on the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Glory</i>, must have sounded like the peeps
of a baby chicken.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p175">Page 175</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>The hefty tanker churned off toward the English
 Channel and I followed after it as fast as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> would go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
took the course Captain <span class=SpellE>Sart</span> had given to reach
Bishop Rock:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>85°.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had one hand firmly on the tiller and the
other on the chicken dinner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was an
unforgettable experience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The captain later sent me a Christmas card and his best
wishes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said he was spending a brief
holiday leave with his wife and two children at their home in Belgium; it was only the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>fourth Christmas he had been able to enjoy with them in the
last thirty years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Events began to move swiftly after the meeting with Captain <span
class=SpellE>Sart</span> and the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Glory</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About 5 P.M. (T.T.) that same day, an R.A.F. <span class=SpellE>Shackleton</span> bomber
found us (aided, no doubt, by a position report radioed by the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> Glory</i> to Lloyd&#39;s of London).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was flying quite low, under a layer of
dark clouds, when the pilot spotted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s
red sail and headed straight for us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
roared by overhead, circled and then roared by twice more, and each time I
waved.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the next pass it came toward
us very low, so low I though it might clip off the tip of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s mast; but it didn&#39;t, luckily.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead, it dropped two</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p176">Page 176</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>bright orange cylindrical canisters tied together with a
buoyant line.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I sailed over and pulled the canisters aboard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They contained a wonderful supply of fruit,
apples and bananas, and a very friendly message from Wing Commander R. A.
Carson of the 42<sup>nd</sup> Squadron of the R.A.F., based at St. <span
class=SpellE>Mawgan</span>, Cornwall, not far from Falmouth, our
destination.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The message said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Welcome to British waters!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You are &#39;big news&#39; and we shall be bringing gentlemen of the press to
see you tomorrow, 9<sup>th</sup> Aug.&#45;at approx. noon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Your present position is 4845N 1220W.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Good luck.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was great to be welcomed so warmly to British waters by
the R.A.F. Commander Carson&#39;s greeting was a wonderfully gracious gesture; but the
thought of being &#34;big news&#34; and meeting gentlemen of the press gave me more
than a moment of trepidation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I tried
to cope with that, the big four-engine plane zoomed toward us again and I gave
it the hands-clasped-over-the-head salute as it swept by so close I could make
out every detail of its constructions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(Those R.A.F. chaps are great fliers.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That night after dinner, as I sat in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s cabin listening to a Voice of America news broadcast
in French, the plot thickened dramatically.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I was taken aback when I heard the announcer say something about Robert
Manry (only he pronounce it &#34;Row-bear Maw-<span class=SpellE>ree</span>,&#34; of
course), <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>navigateur</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> solitaire</i>, and then some stuff that
went too fast for me, with my high-school French, to comprehend.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the newscast was repeated in English a
few minutes later, and that <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>really</i>
bowled me over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It told practically all
there was to tell about me and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and our voyage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I couldn&#39;t imagine were
the Voice of America had got all that information, or why it was interested in the first place.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Somebody on shore must be doing a lot of
talking, I decided, and the circumstantial evidence seemed to point to Virginia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I knew she wouldn&#39;t be talking unless she
was being asked questions; so it seemed probably that the</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p177">Page 177</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>V.O.A. had heard of the voyage and had questioned Virginia about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However the V.O.A. wouldn&#39;t
have heard about it unless the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain
Dealer</i> had run a story on it that the Associated Press had picked up and
put on its wires.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> was apparently more interested in
the voyage than I had thought it was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And the reports from the V.O.A. and the R.A.F. seemed to indicate that
other papers, besides the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>, were
interested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hove to about midnight for some sleep and got up early the next morning, ate a quick breakfast and got
moving again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The wind was just a few
degrees south of due east, which made it impossible to steer directly toward
Bishop Rock, on a course of 85°.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
best we could do was about 57°, which meant we were moving northward of the
direct course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, at about 11 A.M. (T.T.), I went over on the port tack to
regain our southing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Not long afterward I saw a trawler approaching from the
south on a course that would bring us within hailing distance and I wondered
what nationality it was and whether it would stop to exchange a few words.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When it got closer, it became apparent that
it was steering to meet us rather than just to pass by.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It turned out to be English, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i> of Penzance, the port west of Falmouth and not far from Land&#39;s End, and standing at the rail
was a man in a handsome turtle-neck sweater whose face looked vaguely
familiar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And behind him stood another
man who was operating what I took to be a motion-picture camera.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Gradually it dawned on me where I&#39;d seen the face of the man
in the sweater before; it was on the screen of our television receiver at
home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now I knew it; he was a TV
newsman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had heard his broadcasts
hundreds of times, but at the moment I couldn&#39;t remember his name.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I couldn&#39;t imagine what he was doing
there; surely he hadn&#39;t traveled all the way from Cleveland to see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>me</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Undoubtedly he was there for some other
reason and happened to bump into me by chance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But, incredibly, he said he really was looking for me and no one else.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That made our meeting what might be termed &#34;an occasion.&#34;</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p178">Page 178</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>All my instincts told me that now was the time for me to say
something genuinely profound, something that would ricochet endlessly down the
corridors of history, something with the adroitness, depth and impact of, say,
&#34;Dr. Livingstone, I presume.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But all I
could think of was, &#34;Haven&#39;t I seen you somewhere before?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The man finally had to tell me his name, but he took my
mental lapse with good grace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was
Bill Jorgensen of Cleveland&#39;s Scripps-Howard
Station WEWS, and the cameraman with him was Walter Glendenning.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had been cruising about on the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i> for about thirty-five hours,
looking for me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The spot where we met
was roughly two hundred and seventy miles from Land&#39;s End.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As soon as I realized whom I was talking with, a question of
newspaper ethics arose in my mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Could
I in good conscience report details of a trip to these men from WEWS, a
competitor of my employer, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain
Dealer</i>?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, I reasoned, the WEWS
men apparently are very interested in the voyage, so interested they have gone
to enormous lengths and expense to find me, so I think I should tell them
whatever they want to know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt this
way especially when I recalled that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain
Dealer</i> and national magazines I queried before my departure (all of them at
that time believing, because of what I had told them, that I was going on the
voyage with another man in a 25-foot boat) had expressed only mild interest in
printing stories about the venture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ll
have to acknowledge, frankly, that I didn&#39;t think <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s small size would make much difference in the interest
shown by the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> or other newspapers
or the magazines.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s painful for me to
have to admit it now, because my experience should have developed a keener insight
into what makes news, but I failed to assess properly the news value of my own
story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And this failure probably was the
greatest miscalculation of the entire expedition.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m afraid it brands me as somewhat less than
perfect as a newsman.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p179">Page 179</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>So I spoke freely with Jorgensen; in fact, we talked
steadily for three and a half hours while Glendenning took both
movies and still pictures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was good
to see a familiar face, at last.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That
made it seem as though I was actually approaching the end of the voyage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And Captain Victor <span class=SpellE>Watling</span>,
skipper of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i>, and his crew
were most kind to me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They gave me some
delicious apples and some wonderful, fresh hot coffee, the best I&#39;d had since
leaving Massachusetts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The captain also gave me a position report
and a tide table that proved invaluable as <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and I approached the coast of England.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During our conversation Jorgensen showed me a copy of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Packet</i> dated August 6<sup>th</sup>,
and right there on the front page was a story that nearly floored me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;A hero&#39;s welcome awaits 47-year-old American Newspaperman
Robert Manry when he sails his tiny boat <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
into Falmouth Harbour, a few days from now,
at the end of his epic single-handed Atlantic crossing
from Falmouth, Massachusetts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;For nearly 70 days, since he set sail on June 1, Bob Manry
has braved the elements, mastering loneliness and enduring as-yet-untold
discomforts, because of the cramped conditions aboard <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>, to make his dream of an Atlantic crossing come true.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Yesterday newspaper reporters and cameramen from the United States flew into Falmouth to join those of the British press and international news agencies already in town ready to record the scenes as Manry completes his 3,200-mile crossing at
Custom House Quay.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There was more to the story and there were even two
pictures:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a drawing of me and a
photograph of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> that could
only have been taken from the deck of one of the ships we met along the
way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How the Falmouth 
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Packet</i> happened to have either or
both was more than a little puzzling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A &#34;hero&#39;s welcome!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What on earth was building up there in Falmouth?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All I could say to Jorgensen after reading
the first three paragraphs of the story was &#34;My goodness!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Boy, oh, boy!&#34;</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p180">Page 180</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Finally we talked ourselves out and it was time to go our separate ways.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Jorgensen and Glendenning, who had been my guests aboard <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>, scrambled back onto the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i>, which then headed back toward Penzance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The breeze was very light, so <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and I were soon left far behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A few minutes before the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i>
departed, the R.A.F. returned, as it had said it would, presumably with the
&#34;gentlemen of the press.&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This time
there were two <span class=SpellE>Shackletons</span> and a third, twin-engine
civilian plane that flew very fast and low, passing over us again and again,
while the four-engine bombers circled on a broad radius.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the civilian plane had flown over about
eight times, it sped away and one of the <span class=SpellE>Shackletons</span>
came in low, just above masthead height.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then it wheeled and came back, this time dropping two brightly colored
canisters, like those that had been dropped the day before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The R.A.F. fliers must have been using their
fancy bombsight for dropping the canisters because they wound up in the water
no more than ten yards away and directly in front of us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
didn&#39;t have to change course a single degree to enable me to pick them up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The drop and pickup went like clockwork.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first canister contained a bunch of English newspapers,
no doubt so that I could catch up on the news I had missed while out at
sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was glad to have them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I opened the second canister.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had another huge supply of fruit
inside&#45;oranges this time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way things
were going, I&#39;d reach England with more food than I&#39;d had at the start of the voyage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The gifts from the R.A.F., added to what
Captain <span class=SpellE>Sart</span> of the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Belgulf</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'> Glory</i> and Captain <span class=SpellE>Watling</span> of the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Roseland</i> had given me, nearly filled the
cabin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had never been so crammed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Also in the second canister were three notes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first one said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Your position this time:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>50° 12&#39; N-12° 17&#39; W&#45;with the compliments and best wishes of No. 42
Squadron, Royal Air Force&#45;Coastal Command&#45;St. <span class=SpellE>Mawgan</span>,
Cornwall.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It sure was nice of those R.A.F. fellows to keep track of my
position for me; made me fell pretty secure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I knew I wouldn&#39;t</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p181">Page 181</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>get into any trouble with them there, shepherding me along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The second note was a blockbuster.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I read it, the recoil nearly knocked me
out of the boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Bob&#45;We&#39;re waiting for you in Falmouth with Virginia and your children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Dangerous to sail in at night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This harbor is jammed with traffic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You will see our boat somewhere out of Falmouth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia and the children will be aboard with
us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Keep sailing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Good
luck, God bless you, and we&#39;ll see you soon.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The note was signed Bill Ashbolt, George <span class=SpellE>Barmann</span>
and Russ Kane, three men from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain
Dealer</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The news that Virginia and the children were in Falmouth was a real bombshell.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was simply
overjoyed, almost delirious with happiness.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And oh, how I wanted to get into the harbor quickly and meet my
family.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It had been a long time since we
had been together&#45;a long, long time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It turned out that the third note was from Virginia
herself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Dearest Robert&#45;Just think, in a very few days I&#39;ll be
seeing you.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i>
has sent us all over and we&#39;ve been here since last Friday.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;We&#39;ve been living in luxury like royalty, but we surely do
wish you were here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You will be soon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Lots of love.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We&#39;ll
be in a boat to meet you, Virginia.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This was so much more wonderful than anything I had dared
hope for that I was struck numb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
just too much to comprehend all at once.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I had to take it in little doses to keep from becoming dangerously
intoxicated with joy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia and Robin
and Douglas were in Falmouth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were actually there now, at this very
moment, waiting for me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Soon we&#39;d all be
there together, reunited.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
marvelous, terrific, super-colossal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And how generous it was of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Plain Dealer</i> to arrange it.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p182">Page 182</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Thoughts raced through my mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That guy Jorgensen!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He certainly was a sharp newsman, talking with me for more than
three hours and not letting me know that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>P.D.</i> had three men in Falmouth to cover my arrival or that my
family was waiting for me there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not
that I blamed him for keeping mum.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
his place I&#39;d have done the same thing because if he&#39;d told me the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> men and my family were in Falmouth I might not have spilled the whole story of the voyage to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>He was just being a remarkably enterprising reporter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>William A. Ashbolt, on of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Plain Dealer</i> men, was the newspaper&#39;s director of news photography;
George J. <span class=SpellE>Barmann</span> was a veteran of the paper and one
of its ace writers, and Russell W. Kane was an assistant to the publisher and
the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span>
promotion director.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>All three men were good friends of mine and I was delighted
to know that I would soon be seeing them again&#45;and on the eastern side of the
great Western Ocean,
as Europeans often called the Atlantic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was just one little point that worried
me:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the fact that Russ Kane was the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span> promotion
director.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Did that mean my voyage was
going to be turned into a promotional gimmick for the paper?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hoped earnestly, ardently, that was not so;
for I had dreamed of a voyage for too long and it meant too much to me to have it
spoiled at the end by being transformed into a commercial enterprise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If that&#39;s what Russ intended to do, I would
oppose him with every resource at my command.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But first I&#39;d have to wait and see what he actually <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>did</i> intend to do.</p>
