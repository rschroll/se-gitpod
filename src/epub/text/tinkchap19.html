<p class=MsoNormal>This day, our seventy-eighth since leaving Cape
 Cod, promised to be momentous.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There seemed to be a portentous tingle in the air, as if it were charged
with electricity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could feel goose
bumps rising on my skin and spasmodic shivers running up and down my back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hoped I could live through what was coming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were about four miles off the Lizard, as close as I cared
to get because of what I&#39;d heard about the dangerous rip tides that swept
around its base.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn&#39;t want <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s bones to be added to those
of other vessels that littered the ocean floor in that area.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we stayed a comfortable distance offshore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I backed <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s
<span class=SpellE>genny</span> and lashed down her tiller to heave to for some
breakfast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seemed prudent to eat at
once, while I had the chance, to build up strength for what might lie
ahead.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also bathed as well as I could,
shaved, got my mustache into the best shape possible and put on the cleanest
clothes I had.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then I spruced up <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> with Old Glory flying from a
staff at her stern and the Union Jack fluttering from her starboard
shroud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must say she looked a gallant
little lady with those flags snapping merrily in the breeze.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When all these preparations were completed, I looked
shoreward again and found that the Lizard Light had stopped blinking; in the
daylight it was no longer needed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About
the same time the sun rose above the edge of the sea and, soon after,
surrounded us with pleasant warmth.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
heightened the colors and rolling configuration of the country side:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>that beautiful, beautiful land.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It revealed, too, that the sky today, August
17<sup>th</sup>, would be blue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
going to be a wonderful day.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>We started moving again, northeastward toward the fearsome
Manacles, jagged rocks that reached out from the shore like the lower jaw and
teeth of a gigantic monster.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The wind
had shifted into the west and had become several knots lighter, but we were
still able to travel at a good clip.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There were no other vessels in sight; we had this section of the channel
all to ourselves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I looked back over the stern toward the sea we were leaving
behind and again I don&#39;t mind admitting I felt a few sharp pangs of
regret.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was peace out there of a
sort one could never find on land; there was quiet, too, and even more
important, a challenge that brought out the best in one and focused it on
basic, consequential things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt the
experience had enriched my life; and I hoped that, through me, it might touch
the lives of others.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I had become well acquainted with loneliness and I believe
that gave me a greater comprehension of the value of human companionship.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sea had its drawbacks, though; there was
no doubt about that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It couldn&#39;t give
you a formal education (or even a well-balanced informal one), or love or a
helping hand when you needed it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sea
was cold, disinterested, impartial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>There was no real warmth to it, no sharing of knowledge or
feelings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And yet there was one hugely
wonderful thing to be said for the sea; it was always the sea.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the sea and nothing else.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It couldn&#39;t dissimulate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It couldn&#39;t say one thing while thinking
another.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It couldn&#39;t flatter you and
turn your head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There wasn&#39;t a
treacherous or dishonest wave in its whole massive body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another thing I liked about the sea was that I could pit
myself against it without fear of injuring another human being.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing I did mattered at all to the sea;
nothing I did could hurt it in the least.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But in the hurly-burly of life ashore, where people were pitted against
one another in a furious scramble for success, it was almost impossible to avoid
hurting others or</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>being hurt by them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
wasn&#39;t much of a scramble and that&#39;s why I liked that nice cozy seat on the rim
of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i> copy desk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a relatively peaceful spot, like the
eye of a hurricane.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were approaching Black Head now, about halfway between
Lizard Head and the Manacles, and as I looked toward the west I saw a sailboat
disengage itself from the shore and head toward us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then other craft, sailboats and motorboats,
came into sight to the north, all moving in our direction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The first sailboat, the one in the west, closed in fast and
as it passed those on board waved in a most friendly way and called out, &#34;Well
done!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well done!&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I shouted back, &#34;Thank you!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thanks for coming out to see me!&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the first of hundreds of similar
exchanges that took place that day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As we approached the Manacles, I thought that we were
probably sailing over the very same channel floor that the Invincible Armada
had sailed over more than three hundred and seventy-seven years earlier while
on its way to meet the British fleet off Plymouth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And no sooner had the possibility popped into
my mind than another armada appeared on the scene, this one English and headed
south, straight for <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It came toward us fast, turned and
then swept us up into its bosom to escort us the remaining few miles to Falmouth;
and as it moved along it continued to grow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was a fantastic sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One of the first boats to reach us was an R.A.F. launch
carrying a few of the pilots who had so kindly watched over us as we neared the
coast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Someone on the launch thrust a
marvelous sandwich and a nice cup of hot coffee into my hands.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How good each tasted!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was about noon and I was getting hungry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Shortly after that some Royal Navy helicopters arrived to
form an umbrella over us as we sailed in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was wonderful of them to come and I appreciated the honor immensely;
the only trouble was that the backwash from the rotors whipped <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s <span class=SpellE>mains&#39;l</span>
back and forth in an alarming way that prevented it from functioning
properly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It behaved like a
whirligig.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I guess the choppers saw what
was happening, for in a very short</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>time they considerately moved off and things slipped back
more or less to routine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I think it was about one
 o&#39;clock when we passed by the menacing Manacles, keeping well
offshore for safety&#39;s sake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then the
boats really began to swarm around us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They were just like bees around a hive.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was absolutely astounding.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
heard a newsman estimate that there were three hundred craft surrounding <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>, which made this armada more
than twice the size of the Spanish one, in numbers of vessels if not in total</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>tonnage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think
perhaps the man may have put the figure a little high in the enthusiasm of the
moment, but, anyway, there were an awful lot of boats out there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I doubt if anyone had seen anything like it
since World War II, when an enormous fleet of small boats helped to take three
hundred and fifty thousand trapped Allied soldiers off the beaches of Dunkirk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Many of Falmouth&#39;s commercial craft had gone to work ferrying people out to
see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and me as we neared
the harbor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were jammed to the
gunwales and whenever one went by a chorus of &#34;Well <span class=SpellE>dones</span>&#34;
would fill the air.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then I&#39;d call
out &#34;Thank <span class=SpellE>yous</span>&#34; and we&#39;d all wave happily to each other.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Americans often think of the English as being
a little stiff</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>and standoffish, but let me say at once that isn&#39;t
true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have never met more friendly,
more warmhearted people than I met that day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They couldn&#39;t have been nicer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And I must say those Englishmen were no slouches when it
came to business.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can believe this
or not, but postcard pictures of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
sailing along in the armada were being sold even before we reached the harbor
entrance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How it was accomplished, I
don&#39;t know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I do know it was being
done, because I got one of the cards while we were still miles from our goal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Radio newsman Robert Forbes got in some pretty fast licks,
too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He came aboard <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and tape-recorded an interview with me as we sailed along,
then said &#34;Thank you,&#34; got back on his own boat and churned off.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few minutes later, while we were still
sailing toward Black Rock, at the mouth of the harbor, I heard the interview
over a portable radio on an adjacent boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was a novel experience for me to be interviewed in the first place
(as a former reporter, I was accustomed to asking questions instead of
answering them), but to be interviewed and then to hear the interview within a
very few minutes, that was really something!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Before we had progressed very far past the Manacles, the
fishing boat <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Girl Christian</i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>came alongside and on it were Virginia and
Robin and Douglas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was wonderful to
see the children, at last, and to see Virginia again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could hardly wait until we were
all together ashore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What a marvelous
reunion it would be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Daily Mirror</i> newsmen were also on the boat and it was good to see
them again, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We all chatted like
magpies for a few minutes and then the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Girl
Christian</i> hurried back to shore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those
aboard her were to meet me when I docked at Custom House Quay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>By this time it was after 6
 P.M. and although we were only about two miles from the harbor
entrance it began to look as though <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle
</i><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>wasn&#39;t going to make it in before
nightfall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The wind had fallen off to
almost nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were held to an </p>


<p class=MsoNormal>agonizingly slow pace.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But then the harbormaster, Captain Francis H. Edwards, came along and
offered me a tow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had hoped <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> would sail in all by herself
so I was reluctant to accept the offer, but then I thought of all the people
waiting on shore to see us (including the mayor) and how disappointed they
might be and, in fact, how disappointed I would be, too, if we didn&#39;t make it
before dark, so I finally agreed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were soon moving again at a lively pace and the increased
tempo seemed to accentuate the holiday mood of the escorting armada.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Boats circled, crisscrossed and flocked all
about us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several times I thought we
were going to be crushed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People cheered
and shook my hand and gave me the thumbs-up victory sign and passed me things
to eat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One young fellow in a small
runabout stayed alongside for quite a while and gave me a couple of Cornish
pasties.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few persons simply wanted to
touch me, as if I had some magical power to impart.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Others shouted, &#34;Well done!&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;Good show!&#34; or &#34;Glad you made it, mate!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I patted <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
on the stern and said &#34;Well done!&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was nearly seven when we approached Black Rock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Off to port the shore was a solid mass of
people and behind them, at the top of a small hill, were the ruins of Pendennis Castle,
ancient guardian of Falmouth, its
ramparts crowded with more spectators.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>If I half closed my eyes, it was easy to imagine the spectators were
Romans defending the castle against attacking <span class=SpellE>Saxxons</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a spectacular sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We turned to port, moved past Falmouth&#39;s famous docks and shipyards and on to the Custom House Quay.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People were everywhere:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>standing along the shore, perched on window
ledges, leaning out of doorways, crowded onto jetties, thronging the streets,
clinging to trees and cramming the inner harbor in boats of every size and
description.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The whole place was teeming
with humanity.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard later that fifty
thousand people were there to see <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>
and me complete our voyage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I was simply dumfounded, numbed by the enormity of it all and not a little bewildered.  It was just too much to take in all at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I put down a couple of fenders to protect <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> from the stone quayside and
then, after seventy-eight days of living on a pitching, rolling swaying boat, I
stepped ashore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And almost fell flat on
my face!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The quay seemed to be shaking, as if an earthquake were in
progress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wobbled about and staggered
like a man who had had too much grog; and with all those people watching.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was embarrassing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could see it was going to take a few days
to get back my land legs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most of what happened after that is blurred in my mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was too stunned to comprehend fully, or
remember.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do recall, though, that
every boat and ship in the harbor let go with its horn or whistle and shook the
waterfront with reverberating sound as the crowd yelled, R.A.F. <span
class=SpellE>Shackletons</span> flew overhead in wigwagging salutes and a band
on the quay (I heard later it was the St. <span class=SpellE>Stythians</span>
Silver Band) played &#34;The Star-Spangled Banner&#34; and &#34;The Stars and Stripes
Forever.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hugged and kissed Virginia, Robin and Douglas and then met
Samuel A. Hooper, mayor of Falmouth,
who looked most impressive in his scarlet robes and golden chain of
office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He welcomed me to the city and I
apologized for delaying his vacation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then I knelt and kissed the stones of the quay in thanksgiving for a
safe passage across the ocean and in gratitude for the warm welcome I was
receiving.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The pier was a mass of faces.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People waved flags, pointed cameras, fired
flashbulbs, cheered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I waved and shouted
back, &#34;Hi, everybody!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When a newsman
asked me what I though of the welcome, all I could say was &#34;I&#39;m
flabbergasted!&#34;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I felt as if I had
been elected President.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then it was time to go.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We were led through the crowd toward some autos on the quay and Virginia
and I were asked to get into the back of one of them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before I got into the car, I felt pricks of
conscience at the thought of leaving <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i>.</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>I looked back to where I knew Russ Kane and the Falmouth
police were looking after her, but she was hidden by the high side of the quay
and by the crowd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I couldn&#39;t even see
the tip of her mast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was all over now, all behind us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The voyage was dead.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt a lump rising in my throat.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked around and I heard the &#34;Well <span
class=SpellE>dones</span>&#34; and felt the handshakes of those nearest to me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then I knew that, for <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tinkerbelle</i> and me, our voyage over,
what Tinker Belle&#39;s friend Peter Pan had once said was true:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To die <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>was</i>
an awfully big adventure.</p>
