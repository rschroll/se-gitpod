<p class=MsoNormal>The fact that Virginia and Robin and Douglas had got to
Falmouth ahead of me, were there now, made it hard to wait to see them and hear
all about everything that had happened on shore since May 31<sup>st</sup>, when
I had telephoned home from the Falmouth on Cap Cod to bid them and my mother
goodbye.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In some ways it seemed like
years since then; in other ways it seemed like hours.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Naturally, I didn&#39;t hear about the things that had befallen
members of my family until I got to England and was reunited with them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However,
this seems to be the appropriate place to tell that part of the story, so I
shall do so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What follows is quoted from
Virginia&#39;s diary, with my
comments set off by brackets.</p>

<p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tuesday, June 1</i>&#45;Today
Robert left.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He called last night to say
goodbye.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next time I hear his voice he
will be calling me from Falmouth, England to say he made it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wednesday, June 2</i>&#45;We
got up at 6:30 because Nana &#91;my
mother, Mrs. James C. Manry&#93; had to catch an early bus home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was pouring and the freeway was bumper to
bumper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the bus was a half hour
late.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;David <span class=SpellE>Losh</span> &#91;one of Robin&#39;s
classmates&#93; brought a harness for Puff &#91;Douglas&#39;s
iguana&#93; to wear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While he was telling me
about it the phone rang.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was George <span
class=SpellE>Barmann</span> of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain
Dealer</i>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Seems they had received
Robert&#39;s letter telling them he was going alone and they wanted to know the
details.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>George was so excited he had to
call back a couple of times for more facts.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p184">Page 184</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Ray <span class=SpellE>Matjasic</span> &#91;a P.D.
photographer&#93; came and took pictures of us toasting Robert in milk.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The kids didn&#39;t like all the fuss, but they
cooperated.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the 7 o&#39;clock news Bud <span class=SpellE>Dancey</span> told
about Robert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thursday, June 3</i>&#45;At
7:30 A.M. the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Press</i> called and asked to use the story.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A girl from the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>News-Herald</i> came to interview me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The phone rang and it was Bill <span class=SpellE>Litzkow</span>
of the Falmouth marina &#91;from which
I had embarked&#93;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He sounded concerned
and wondered if I had heard from Robert.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I said no, and he asked if he could tell anyone now.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bless his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;A few more minutes and the phone rang again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was John Hough of the Falmouth <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Enterprise</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He promised to pass on any word he might come
by.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monday, June 7</i>&#45;Just
a week ago tonight I said bon voyage to my own dear Robert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He&#39;s never far away from my thoughts.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just sort of counterpoint to everything I say
and do.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Tomorrow is Douglas&#39;s birthday.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not much of a celebration without his Dad,
but I&#39;ll try to make it a nice one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Robin said today:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&#39;People speak about Dad as though he were dead.&#39;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Won&#39;t they be surprised when he turns up 75
days from now, tanned, lean and fit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The astronauts are back down.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wish Robert were across.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I imagine he has begun to miss his nice bed,
lumps and all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I can&#39;t seem to accomplish much.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lonesome, I guess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Friday, June 11</i>&#45; I&#39;ve
been working in the back yard all day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It&#39;s 9:30 and I&#39;ve just
crawled out of the tub and now I&#39;m going to rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I discovered some little rosebushes sprouting around under
the trees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ve weeded around them and I
hope they&#39;ll grow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I cut the grass and I
felt like The Neighbor in Edna St. Vincent <span class=SpellE>Millay&#39;s</span>
poem:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I left &#39;the clover standing, And
the Queen Anne&#39;s lace!&#39;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Funny the things I remember about Robert and me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While I was mowing around the lovely pink
clover I remembered a</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p185">Page 185</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>field near a motel where we had stopped during a vacation
trip.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were walking Chris &#91;our German
Shepard&#93; and the smell of clover brought the whole scene back so clearly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Made me kind of sad.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I cleaned his dark room yesterday, too, and that brought
him near.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sunday, June 13</i>&#45;Mother
and John &#91;Virginia&#39;s mother and
brother&#93; came today &#91;from their home in Pittsburgh,
 Pa.&#93.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Mother will stay with me for as long as she can take us.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Poor Chris got a walk finally.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She pestered John so he took her for a nice
long one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sunday, June 20</i>&#45;At
about 10:15 P.M. the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i>
called to tell me the Coast Guard received word from a Canadian freighter &#91;the <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Exilona</i></span>&#93; that
Robert was 500 miles out and needed no assistance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was wonderful to hear he is all
right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He&#39;s not making much time, 19
days out, but he will eventually, I&#39;m sure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Perhaps I&#39;ll even get a letter next time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m glad Mother and John were here when the
word came; they are so anxious.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mother
is not too fond of boats, but she is being very brave about Robert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, she has confidence in him and that
means a lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monday, June 21</i>&#45;Fred
&#91;the family cat&#93; seems to like her name even though she is a girl.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She got out around 11:15 tonight and we had quite a time rounding her up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wednesday, June 23</i>&#45;I
couldn&#39;t sleep last night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All sorts of
visions racing through my head.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do
wish we had enough in the bank to take us all to England to meet Robert.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That&#39;s been my dream for
years, to visit England
and see all I&#39;ve read about.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Seems Robert had gone 585 miles instead of 500.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thursday, June 24</i>&#45;George
called to tell me he had been to New York to talk to the captain of the freighter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The captain thinks at his present rate of speed, it will take Robert 91
days to reach England.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Friday, June 25</i>&#45;A
quiet day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s good to have one now and</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p186">Page 186</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>then.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since the
excitement began I&#39;ve had trouble sleeping.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I know Robert will be all right, but when the captain said 91 days it
conjured up all sorts of pictures.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it
took Crapo 51 days, Robert should surely make it in less than 91.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I hope he won&#39;t be too annoyed with all the publicity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I&#39;m planning to go to Pittsburgh for the Fourth of July.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hate being
away from home for so long.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chris seems
sad to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thursday, July 1</i>&#45;If
Robert were on schedule he&#39;d be pretty close to eating his plum pudding.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wish he were halfway there.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Poor Robert, I feel sorry for him, but then he may be
enjoying it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#91;I was, most of the time.&#93;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Paid all our bills today and we&#39;re all set for another
month, at least.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Sunday, July 4</i>&#45;People
are beginning to ask me if we are going to England to meet Robert.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They&#39;re even talking
about having a parade in his honor!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
can&#39;t imagine him sitting on the back of a car waving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I asked Robin if she would like to go to
England to meet
him she said that if she went the kids would think she was stuck-up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can&#39;t imagine why.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monday, July 5</i>&#45;We&#39;re
going to Pittsburgh tomorrow, John
is coming for me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Douglas is disappointed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He wanted to take his
vacation on a bus; says now it won&#39;t seem like one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wish I could take him to England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robin says she still wouldn&#39;t want to go to England because of the kids&#39; attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wednesday, July 7</i>&#45;John
is trying to figure out a way to get me to Cornwall.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He keeps giving me guidebooks to read, the
rascal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of them, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rambles in Cornwall</i>, calls Falmouth &#39;The Happy <span class=SpellE>Harbour</span>.&#39;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I surely wish I could be there to meet Robert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe if I wish hard enough I can.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Friday, July 9</i>&#45;We
heard from Robert again tonight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Jo <span
class=SpellE>Talladino</span> &#91;one of our neighbors&#93; called Pittsburgh to tell me someone had called when she was in our house feeding the
menagerie.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said a Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Larick</span> from the <span class=SpellE>Istmian</span> Lines
steamship company telephoned to tell me that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Steel Vendor</i> had picked up 10 letters from Robert and that he was
about</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p187">Page 187</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>1,000 miles east of Boston.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All was well aboard and he expects to make England about August 15.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Last night before I went to sleep I looked at the full moon
and thought that Robert was watching the same moon.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wished on it and said a little prayer that
we&#39;d hear from him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My prayer was
answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monday, July 12</i>&#45;Today
began with a bang.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Three letters from
Robert for me and two for the children.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Then began a struggle between the newspapers as to who should print
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i> is his paper and they
deserved first chance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The family scolded me for permitting even the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Plain Dealer</i> to use them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As they said, &#39;Dad won&#39;t like it a bit.&#39;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#91;They were right; I didn&#39;t like it.&#93;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hope they don&#39;t use the entire letter, parts
of it are personal.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#91;They used the whole
thing.&#93;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I should have typed out a
passage and made them settle for that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Robin was interviewed for the second time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She sounded as though she had been doing it
all her life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Everything is fine with Robert except he is lonesome.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Says no more solo sails for him.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also, he&#39;s losing weight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Good.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tuesday, July 13</i>&#45;A
very exciting thing happened today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A
Mr. Davis from the London <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Daily</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Express</i> called from New York asking for a story about Robert.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told
him how we envied his seeing England
and we would have to be content just to hear about it, and how he had orders to
stop at Liverpool to pick up just any old piece of soil
that the Beatles might have stepped on once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The battery in the car is dead again and the kids had a
grand time pushing the car up and down driveways to <span class=SpellE>Perkeys</span>&#39;
&#91;neighbors&#93; for a booster to the battery.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I&#39;m collecting the rocks the neighbors dig up in their
yards when they have swimming pools put in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I want to make a rock garden.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Can&#39;t seem to do much else about it, though.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lonesome, I guess.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p188">Page 188</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Wednesday, July 14</i>&#45;Victor
Davis of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Daily Express</i> called to tell me his paper carried the story.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He&#39;s sending me a copy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I called the insurance company about extending Robert&#39;s
special policies, in case he does take 90 days. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Also the lawyer about my will.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I blew myself to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Mary
<span class=SpellE>Poppins</span></i> tonight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I needed to get away from the house and get my mind off things.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Goldfinger</i></span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>is coming on July 28, at last.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now Douglas can stop
worrying about missing it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is counting
the days.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thursday, July 15</i>&#45;The
editor of the Falmouth <i
  style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Enterprise</i>
tells me Falmouth, Cornwall,
is planning a royal reception for Robert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Friday, July 16</i>&#45;Today
started out badly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The washer hose broke
and I had a regular geyser of steaming water shooting all over the ceiling and
then onto the washing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What a mess.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The place was like a Turkish bath.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got a new hose and installed it
myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robert would be so proud of
bumbling me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;About 4:30 Ray <span
class=SpellE>Matjasic</span> called to ask if I could hurry down to see a movie
of Robert taken by the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Steel Vendor</i>&#39;s
cook.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Douglas went with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Robert was all in the
shadow, but he looked so dear and familiar, waving just as we used to see him
doing on Lake Erie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Next week Phil Porter &#91;the <span class=SpellE><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>&#39;s</span> executive editor&#91; and Russ
Kane want to talk to me about a possible trip to Falmouth!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Julian Wilson, the Associated Press photographer,
said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#39;He doesn&#39;t belong to just us now,
he belongs to the world,&#39; and he formed a huge circle with his arms.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Imagine, my husband!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m glad he belongs to me, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;John Metcalfe said:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&#39;You have to watch these quiet ones.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>They&#39;re the ones to stir things up,&#39; or words to that effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;It&#39;s hard for us to realize how famous he has become.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One thing is sure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Life can&#39;t ever be the same for Robert.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With a taste of adventure, he&#39;s bound to want
more; and so will we.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Monday, July 19</i>&#45;Today
was hectic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d rather have them that
way, though; I don&#39;t miss Robert so much then.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p189">Page 189</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;This morning I took Chris to the veterinarian&#39;s for a blood
sample.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just as they thought, she has a
serious infection and must have her uterus removed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Doug and I went to town for some school clothes for him,
and some to wear to England.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We&#39;re going there, it seems.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;This evening we got the television picture tube fixed:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#36;33.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Tomorrow I have to have my tooth fixed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>More money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Chris&#39;s operation
will be at least &#36;50, plus the <span class=SpellE>additionals</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bank account sure is disappearing fast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Tonight Mother called to tell me she has my birth
certificate (needed to get a passport).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I also splurged and bought two pairs of shoes, on sale, and a handbag
and hose for my visit to the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>
tomorrow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Tuesday, July 20</i>&#45;Hectic
is no word for today.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fantabulous about
fills it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got in early at the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>P.D.</i>, had a cup of tea and a cookie,
talked to Mary <span class=SpellE>Hirschfeld</span>, who writes the &#39;Mary
Hears&#39; column, and then met Russ Kane, Phil Porter and Russ Reeves, day
managing editor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#39;Well, Robert is to receive his pay for the entire six weeks

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;It&#39;s a strange feeling to leave
at dusk and see the sun set and a bit later see the sun rise from the same
side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They say it&#39;s because of the
earth&#39;s curvature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;Russ was still wearing his

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;He and Bill Ashbolt spent almost
the whole trip trying to fix a secondhand movie camera they had bought in Washington,

all snapping away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Interviews by
reporters with those heavenly British accents, and then a drive to the Whitehall

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;Eric Piper, a <i

Russ knocked on the door I awoke as though I&#39;d been raised from the dead.<span

glimpse of the Greenbank Hotel in Falmouth.<span

leading off a lovely flower garden in front of the hotel.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From it we could look straight through the
lobby onto a blue, blue harbor with sailboats anchored peacefully and sea gulls
wheeling about, the sun streaming into the glassed-in lounge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;The manager, Avon <span

get a good rest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'>&#34;Tom Reedy, the AP man from London,
