<p class=MsoNormal>We arose early the next morning, Sunday, May 23<sup>rd</sup>,
and, after a hurried breakfast, started loading my supplies into our little
station wagon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This job took much longer
than expected, so we weren&#39;t ready to leave until after 3 P.M.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goodbyes were relatively painless, for no tears were
shed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We kissed and hugged with
assurance that we weren&#39;t doing it for the last time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My mother and the two children understood
what I aimed to do and were confident I would survive, although they may have
had some doubts about whether I would get all the way across the ocean.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It may seem odd, but the goodbye I was most
concerned about at this time was my goodbye to <span class=SpellE>Chrissy</span>,
our five-year-old German shepherd.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After
all, I was able to explain to my mother and the children why I was leaving and
how long I&#39;d be away, but to <span class=SpellE>Chrissy</span> it would almost
certainly seem as though she had been deserted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I couldn&#39;t possibly explain to her that I&#39;d be back in three
months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nevertheless, I tried to be
reassuring by speaking affectionately and rubbing noses with her and scratching
her neck, the way she loved me to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
anyway, maybe she wouldn&#39;t miss me much at that, for now, instead of having to
sleep at the foot of my bed, she&#39;d get the whole bed to herself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Come to think of it, after three months of
such indulgence she might be sorry to see me return.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No matter; she was my special girl and I
loved her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then I bade a fond farewell to Fred, our cat, and to Puff, Douglas&#39;s
iguana, and climbed into the driver&#39;s seat beside Virginia and her
brother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The car&#39;s springs sagged </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p49">Page 49</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>with
the weight of the provisions and of <i>Tinkerbelle </i>hitched
on behind, but all we could do was hope the strain wouldn&#39;t be too much for
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had to get moving.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, with waves to mother, the children and
the gathering neighbors, we struggled off, the engine laboring mightily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We were blessed with good fortune, for the next day at about
7:30 P.M. we arrived in Falmouth,
after an overnight stay at a motel near Batavia,
 New York, without the car&#39;s having suffered
any sort of breakdown.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We put up at a
very comfortable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>motel about a quarter-mile from Vineyard Sound, and before
we went to bed that night, we drove down to the shore and looked out over the
water which, in a few more days, <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I would traverse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m not sure what the others felt, but I
tingled with an intense sensation of awe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next day we devoted to sightseeing, as if we were a
group of tourists.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had breakfast at a
charming little place in Woods Hole and, afterward, looked over the buildings
of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution where my brother had once been
employed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then we drove to Chatham,
at the southeast corner of the Cape, and browsed through
some souvenir shops, in one of which I bought Virginia
a little silver dolphin for her charm bracelet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&#34;A lucky dolphin,&#34; I called it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What made Chatham especially interesting to me was the fact that in 1877, Thomas Crapo </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p50">Page 50</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>and his wife had sailed from
there in the 19 ½-foot <i>New Bedford</i>,
bound for England.
They arrived at <span class=SpellE>Newlyn</span>, near Penzance, Cornwall,
fifty-one days later, after a truly remarkable voyage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We went on, next, to a lovely sandy beach where we ate a
fine picnic lunch as we looked out over the blue Atlantic,
which, that day, was in a warm, contented mood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And then we visited Provincetown and saw some of the fascinating characters of that famous art colony.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also fed a huge flock of sea gulls from
the end of a long pier where the fishing boats docked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The following day, Wednesday, May 26<sup>th</sup>, we
trailed <i>Tinkerbelle</i> over to Falmouth&#39;s Inner Harbor and, at a marina operated by F. W. (Bill) <span class=SpellE>Litzkow</span>, a
big, friendly man, <i>Tinkerbelle</i> was hoisted from her trailer and lowered
into the salt water.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was her first
taste of the sea and she took to it as though she&#39;d been tasting it all her
life.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I couldn&#39;t stand around just admiring her; there was a
lot to be done.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had to load her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I paddled her over to a nearby dock and went
to work raising her mast and bending on her sails while Virginia and John
filled all the plastic containers with water and brought them over to be stowed
away under her cockpit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I packed in
the eight big bags of food and the Victory Girl, sextant, radio, blankets,
charts, spare batteries, flotation planks and all the rest of my
equipment.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were an awful lot of
things to get into that little boat, but somehow I found a spot for
everything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the loading was
completed, <i>Tinkerbelle</i> was sitting lower in the water than she&#39;d ever
done before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I guess she had only eight
or nine inches of freeboard although, empty, she had more than twelve inches.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The lack of freeboard didn&#39;t worry me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believed the weight would give her
increased stability.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And I kept thinking
of something Ben Carlin had written in <i>Half Safe</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had said freeboard was like a chin stuck
out to be hit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To me, that made a lot of
sense.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p51">Page 51</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>While the loading was under way, Bill <span class=SpellE>Litzkow&#39;s</span>
eyes must have bulged at the sight of all the material we were putting aboard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Where&#39;s he going?&#34; he asked Virginia and John in a confidential
tone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&#34;England?&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My two fellow conspirators were taken aback, for no one else
had suspected our secret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;How&#39;d you guess?&#34; said John, with a mysterious grin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Then he and Virginia swore Bill to silence, and Bill
promised he wouldn&#39;t breathe a word to anyone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He kept his word, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He didn&#39;t
even mention it to me in the five days I remained at his dock preparing for
departure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I found out later that after
I&#39;d gone he telephoned Virginia and
finally got her permission to break his silence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bill was a man you could trust.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Another man you could trust was Virginia&#39;s
brother, John Place, a
rewrite expert on the Pittsburgh <i>Press</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was using a week of his vacation to help
Virginia and me, and, although he considered my voyage extremely newsworthy, he
didn&#39;t even tip off his own newspaper until I was safely out of reach at
sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was rare trustworthiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Late that afternoon we did some more shopping.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Virginia bought me a fine sweater and a book
about sea birds to help me identify the birds I saw on the Atlantic (I already
had two other books I hoped to read along the way:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Margaret Mitchell&#39;s <i>Gone With the Wind</i>
and John Le <span class=SpellE>Carre&#39;s</span> <i>The Spy Who Came In from the
Cold</i>), and John got me a harmonica and some books of music to help pass the
time if and when I was becalmed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And in
the evening we had a delicious farewell dinner at a restaurant overlooking the
harbor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think we all felt a little
self-conscious, not knowing quite what to say, but we enjoyed ourselves,
anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The next morning John and Virginia began their journey back
to Willowick with <i>Tinkerbelle&#39;s</i> trailer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is an old superstition of the sea that if you wave a
ship out of sight you&#39;ll never </p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p52">Page 52</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>see it again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>John and Virginia wouldn&#39;t be there to wave me out of sight when I set sail,
but I was there to wave them out of sight as they set off for Willowick; and I brought them a
heap of misfortune.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not even the lucky
dolphin I&#39;d given Virginia could
forestall it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On the New York Thruway,
near Oneida, right at a tollgate,
the car gave up the ghost and refused to budge.  Virginia told me later
over the telephone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They&#39;d had the car towed to a garage, where it was learned
that the engine was beyond repair; they&#39;d need a new one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So Virginia wired our bank for some money and they got the new engine and finally, after
dark on May 29<sup>th</sup>, a day late, they arrived back in Willowick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the next two days I occupied myself aboard <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
with moving my stores into what I hoped would be the most convenient
arrangement and in lashing them down so firmly that they wouldn&#39;t shift even if
the boat was turned over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I also did
some last-minute varnishing and worked out a way to carry the oars on either
side of the cockpit with their blades extending out beyond the stern of the
boat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wanted them where I could get at
them easily, for I might have to put them to use at a moment&#39;s notice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Once all my gear was packed away as I wanted it, I swung the
boat to check the compass.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It&#39;s a good
thing I did, for I found a substantial error on the east-west heading.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, once it was discovered, it was
easily corrected and I gained the satisfaction of knowing that I could then
rely on the instrument.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The night of Monday, May 31<sup>st</sup>, my last night
ashore for some time, I had supper at a little restaurant on the city&#39;s main
street and, while I was eating, reviewed the circumstances that had led me to
select Falmouth as my port of
departure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Actually, the first thing I&#39;d
done was to choose the port I wanted to arrive at in England and, in the
beginning, I&#39;d thought the best one would be <span class=SpellE>Penzance</span>,
for it was near a tip of England that stretched out toward the United States
like a hand offered to a friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the
<i>Sailing Directions</i> mentioned various difficulties</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p53">Page 53</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>and dangers connected with entering <span class=SpellE>Penzance</span>,
or <span class=SpellE>Newlyn</span>, the adjacent harbor where the <span
class=SpellE>Crapos</span> had landed, so I decided to go on to Falmouth, which
seemed to have an excellent harbor that could be entered without danger,
although there was one sentence in the <i>Sailing Directions</i> that made me a
bit nervous &#34;Falmouth experiences a remarkably high number of strong winds and
gales.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I&#39;d just have to hope no gale was blowing when I arrived on
the scene.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, I decided to end my
voyage at Falmouth, in Cornwall,
and it remained only to decide where to start it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I&#39;d thought I&#39;d best embark at a port from which I could
sail southeastward handily to get across the shipping lanes out of New
  York City as soon as possible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next to the approach to England,
I expected this first part of the voyage to be the most dangerous because of
the heavy ship traffic.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On studying the
map I decided that some harbor on the southern shore
 of Cape Cod would do very nicely as
a starting point and then I discovered a Falmouth
there, too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So that settled it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d sail from Falmouth,
 U.S.A., a former
shipbuilding center and whaling port, to Falmouth,
 England, a famous
maritime town and resort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About 9 P.M. I
telephoned Willowick
and said goodbye to mother, Robin, Douglas and Virginia, all of whom were still
confident of my success.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I left the
telephone booth and walked slowly back to <i>Tinkerbelle</i>, I was seized by
an intense realization of my great good fortune in having a mother and family
like mine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How many mothers, sons,
daughters and wives were there in the United
  States or the world who would let their son,
father or husband do what I was doing?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It struck me that probably there were very few.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d seen too many men whose lives were hemmed
in by strict adherence to the conventional demands of a business or profession
or marriage; too many whose lives were pallid by the fear of being different,
of being criticized, of failing to meet all their responsibilities (as <i>others</i>
saw them).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I knew these fears well
indeed because I had cringed before them myself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The pressure</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p54">Page 54</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>to conform that pervades our society has a basically useful
function, I suppose, but I wonder if it isn&#39;t too intense, too rigid, or
perhaps misdirected, so that it stifles the freedom of living that leads to
happiness and, incidentally, to an intellectually richer environment for
everyone.</p>

<p>I was positive no one in the world had as wonderful a wife
as mine.  Virginia&#39;s
quiet faith was an extraordinary compliment and a priceless gift such as few
men received in their lives from anyone.  She could have insisted that I behave as other &#34;rational&#34; men did and
give up any notion of taking this &#34;crazy&#34; voyage.  But she didn&#39;t.  She knew I was stepping to the music of a
different drummer and she granted me the invaluable boon of self-realization by
allowing me to keep pace with the music I heard.  I was poor in dollars and cents, but rich in
love.  I hoped I would prove worthy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On the way back to the boat I mailed some letters.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One was to the <i>Plain Dealer</i>&#39;s
executive editor and others were to friends on the copy desk, and they all
revealed the truth about my voyage:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>that
instead of going with someone else in his 25-foot boat, as I had originally
expected to, I was going alone in my own <i>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hoped that no one at the <i>P.D.</i> would
think too harshly of me for my deception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There were also letters for Virginia and close relatives who already knew the facts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When I got to the dock, <i>Tinkerbelle </i>somehow seemed to
be in an expectant mood, as though she knew what was ahead.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was certainly as ready, as prepared, as
any boat her size could be.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was
just one thing missing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hadn&#39;t been
able to find the chemical shark repellant anywhere and, earlier, on the phone,
when I&#39;d mentioned it to Virginia,
she had informed me the repellant had accidentally been left at home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was there now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;You&#39;ll have to make friends with a dolphin and have him
keep the sharks away,&#34; Virginia had said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I said, yes, I guessed that was what I&#39;d have to do.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p55">Page 55</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>It didn&#39;t worry me because I understood the repellant wasn&#39;t especially
effective.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d read a report by a &#34;shark
research panel&#34; of Navy and civilian scientists that said the trouble with most
shark repellants was that those that worked at all were as likely to attract
sharks as to shoo them off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So maybe I
was better off without the chemical shark chasers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Soon I was in <i>Tinkerbelle</i>&#39;s cabin, curled up under a
blanket.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Tomorrow would be a long, hard
day of sailing; in fact, I might have to continue sailing for two or three days
and nights without sleep to get safely across the shipping lanes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told myself I&#39;d better get all the rest I
could that night, for it was the last one I&#39;d spend in the safety of a harbor
for many days to come.</p>
