<p class=MsoNormal>When I awoke, the sun was shining brightly, dotting the
undulating cobalt of the ocean to the east with diamond flashes of intense
light, and <i>Tinkerbelle</i> was tugging good-naturedly at her bucket anchor,
nosing into a docile, westerly breeze.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Happiness, that morning, was a body replete with rest&#45;a body gorged,
crammed, satiated with sleep&#45;and I was happy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was great to be alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I cooked a breakfast of hot cereal and coffee, and, as I
ate, ruminated on the events of the previous day.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That seafaring hitchhiker, where had he come
from and where had he gone?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was he part
of a daydream?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or something else?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or was my mind coming unglued?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seemed possible that I <i>had</i> dreamed
the encounter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In any case, it would do
no good to worry overmuch about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
knew that truck drivers who took pep pills to stay awake sometimes &#34;saw&#34;
things, and even Slocum had been visited by an apparition&#45;the pilot of Columbus&#39;s
<span class=SpellE><i>Pinta</i></span>, so he, the shade had said.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Slocum had ascribed the visitation to cramps
caused by eating Azores plums and white cheese.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hadn&#39;t had any cramps, so I had to look
elsewhere for cause.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The hallucination,
I theorized, must have been induced by lack of sleep and the pills.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Neither <i>Tinkerbelle</i> nor I had suffered a serious
mishap, we were both in good shape, but the weirdness of the experience left me
feeling uneasy&#45;half fearful, half embarrassed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The whole affair seemed so unnatural, so preposterous.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was so sensitive about it that I refrained
from mentioning it in my log.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not until
much later, after I&#39;d had other, similar experiences, did I write anything
about the illusory events of that afternoon.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p97">Page 97</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>After breakfast I washed my saucepan, cup, fork and spoon in
the sea and tidied up the cabin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I
heated some water and shaved for the first time since leaving Falmouth;
that is, I shaved all but my upper lip, for, in response to Virginia&#39;s
urgings, I had decided to grow a mustache.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I hoped that by the time I reached England it would be a luxuriant, sea-<span class=SpellE>dogish</span> growth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d never had a satisfactory mustache,
although once before I&#39;d tried to raise one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The in-between days, when the bristles were ample enough to make your
lip look dirty and yet too puny to keep your friends from inquiring (if only
with their eyes) why you hadn&#39;t shaved, were slightly discomfiting.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But now I had a chance to escape all that; I
would be out of sight for enough days.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
could simply turn up on the other side of the ocean with a mature set of handle
bars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A gentle breeze of about ten miles an hour blew steadily
from the west, so I rigged <i>Tinkerbelle</i> to steer herself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had tested the self-steering arrangement on
Lake Erie and it had worked well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It consisted of twin genoas winged out on
either side of the forestay (the oars having been adapted to serve as whisker
poles for that purpose), with sheets running back from the clew of each sail,
through blocks on either side of the cockpit, to the tiller.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sails were adjusted to slant slightly
forward from the forestay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, if <i>Tinkerbelle</i>
veered a little to port, the portside <span class=SpellE>genny</span> caught
more wind and the starboard-side <span class=SpellE>genny</span> spilled more,
which, in turn, caused a pull on the port sheet and an easing up on the
starboard sheet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That put the tiller
over to port, making the boat return to her proper course before the wind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And, of course, it worked the same way, but
in reverse, if she veered to starboard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As a matter of fact, by adjusting the sheets, the boat could be made to
steer herself on a course that was a few degrees to port or starboard of the
exactly-before-the-wind course.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(However, I was never able to get the boat to steer herself on a reach
or when the wind was forward of the beam.)</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p98">Page 98</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Tinkerbelle</i> tobogganed along amiably, steering
herself skillfully and, seemingly, without effort.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was a good girl.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I delighted in her obedient behavior and in
my freedom from the tiller.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could do anything
I wished now without impeding our steady eastward progress.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To be sailing without any effort whatever,
without having to be concerned with steering, that was undiluted ecstasy!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But I couldn&#39;t spend all day glorying in ecstatic idleness;
there were other things to be done.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
brought on deck clothes and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>blankets dampened by humid sea air and spread them in the
sun to dry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I took a sextant shot
at the sun in an effort to get a clue to our position, but something went wrong
with the shot or the figuring, for I wound up with a sun line that was too
fantastic to be believed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At noon I tried again, this time for a latitude
shot, but again something went wrong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The latitude I got was 45° N, which couldn&#39;t possibly have been right
unless <i>Tinkerbelle</i> had flown three hundred miles or more during the night
while I was asleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was a marvelous
boat, no doubt about that, but a three-hundred-mile flight did seem a trifle
beyond her capacities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Oh, well,
tomorrow I&#39;d try once more to pinpoint our position.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p99">Page 99</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>About five-thirty that evening a trawler hove into view and,
seeing <i>Tinkerbelle</i>, churned over to within a few yards of us, its
diesels clattering noisily.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the <i>Major
J. Casey</i>, American or Canadian, I couldn&#39;t tell which.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I cupped my hands and shouted to two fellows
at the rail, asking if they&#39;d give me my position, but I guess they couldn&#39;t
hear me above the strident din of their vessel.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I needed a megaphone to focus and project my voice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Boris <span class=SpellE>Petroff</span> of
the <i>Plain Dealer</i>&#39;s library staff had urged me to take one along despite
the valuable space it would consume.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&#34;It&#39;s a vital piece of equipment,&#34; he had said, and now this inability
to make myself heard tended to confirm his opinion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Wait till he found out about that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;d never hear the end of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I could understand the men on the trawler, however.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Where you bound?&#34; one of them yelled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;England,&#34;
I hollered back with all my lung power.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>They didn&#39;t even flick an eyelid, so I imagine they either
didn&#39;t hear me or thought I was having a little joke.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, they swerved away right after that
and sped off to the southeast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a few
minutes I was alone again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not really
alone, though; I had <i>Tinkerbelle</i> with me, and she was good company.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As darkness fell, the wind grew stronger and I had to
discontinue the self-steering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(It
turned out that I never used the twin genoas for self-steering again, as one of
the pair was an old canvas sail that tore to shreds in a hard blow a few days
later.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The surviving <span class=SpellE>genoa</span>
was a <span class=SpellE>dacron</span> sail I had made myself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I should have made two of them.)<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I returned to my post at the tiller and we
went on under a single <span class=SpellE>genny</span> at four or five knots
until nearly midnight.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then I &#34;parked&#34; <i>Tinkerbelle</i> to the
sea-anchor setups to determine which worked best.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One rig I tested had the regular <span
class=SpellE>Danforth</span> anchor and the canvas bucket drogue linked in
tandem at the end of the hundred-and-fifty-foot nylon anchor line.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I studied the</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p100">Page 100</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>boat&#39;s behavior for about an hour, eventually deciding this
arrangement wasn&#39;t a success, for instead of sloping off from the bow, the line
hung straight down and didn&#39;t keep the boat headed squarely into the
waves.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several times she nearly turned
broadside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I started to pull the
line up to test another setup, I found that either the <span class=SpellE>Danforth</span>
was a lot heavier than I had thought or it had snagged a fish or some other
heavy object.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was hard work getting
it on board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I finally hauled it up,
though, and when the bucket broke the surface I got a terrific shock; it was
filled with sand!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No wonder it had been
heavy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was only one possible
explanation:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we were in a shoal area
where the sea was no more than a hundred and fifty feet deep and possibly a
good deal shallower than that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This threw my dead reckoning for a loop since, according to
it, we were supposed to be in water that was more than a mile deep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>How could I have gone so far wrong?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I couldn&#39;t answer that question, but in view
of the circumstances it seemed reasonable to conclude that the time had come to
obtain a better indication of where we were.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Just before the sun reached its zenith, I got out the
sextant and, summoning forth my best efforts, took as accurate a noon latitude sight as I could, using the
natural horizon rather than the bubble.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When I worked out the sight, I got another shock; the figures said our latitude
was 41° 2&#39; N, about sixty miles north of my dead-reckoning latitude.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got out the chart and deduced from this
latitude figure and the shallowness of the water that we were probably at the
southernmost edge of Cultivator Shoal, some ninety miles east of Nantucket.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That made our longitude roughly 68° 32&#39;W, not
nearly so far eastward as I had imagined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This blunt exposure of my shortcomings as a navigator left
me shaken.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Had I, in attempting an
Atlantic crossing, bitten off more than I could chew?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was I likely to sail into, say, Brest,
 France, thinking it was Falmouth, England, or do something
else equally ridiculous?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I earnestly
hoped not.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But if the navigational</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p101">Page 101</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>clumsiness that had just been laid bare continued, it seemed
possible that I would.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Of course, there
were important lessons to be learned from this chastening experience, the
principal one being not to put much faith in dead reckoning (the boat&#39;s speed
over the bottom and the influence of currents were too difficult to assess),
but that didn&#39;t make me feel any better.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Here I&#39;d thought we were south of the shipping lanes and, actually, we
were still thirty miles or so north of them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I re-examined the chart, reread the <i>Coast Pilot</i> and
sent my mind ranging back over the days since we had left Vineyard Sound,
trying to find clues to how our actual course had varied from my dead
reckoning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What about those bright
lights I&#39;d seen in the early morning darkness on the third day out?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had supposed they were on a buoy, but now I
had doubts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Soon I found a paragraph in <i>Coast
Pilot</i> that appeared to solve the mystery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It said, &#34;A Texas tower of lights and a fog signal surmounted by radar
and radio towers, is in 41° N and 69° 30&#39; W, near the southwest side of Fishing
Rip.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The entire structure is
floodlighted at night.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So that&#39;s what had made that &#34;buoy&#34; seem so bright; it had
been floodlighted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fishing Rip was a shallow area at the southern end of
Nantucket Shoals, southeast of Nantucket, and the Texas tower on it
was about twenty-five miles from the island.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>What <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I had done, then, was to sail between the
tower and the Nantucket Shoals Lightship, which was roughly twenty-seven miles
due south of it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When the storm hit us,
right after we passed the tower, we had drifted fifteen or twenty miles
southeastward, and the next day, while I was in the grip of that hallucination,
we had cruised around aimlessly, getting nowhere.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, after those sublime hours of sleep, we
had steered the 50° course that brought us to the southern tip of Cultivator
Shoal, where the bucket startled me by scooping up sand from the bottom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now I had an inkling of where we were.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p102">Page 102</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>Late in the day, after more sea anchor experiments, I
tethered <i>Tinkerbelle</i> to what seemed to be the most efficient
rig, the canvas bucket used by itself with a float and line attached to keep it
from sinking more than fifteen feet below the surface, and took a short nap in
the cockpit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Afterward, I fixed myself a
tasty dinner of curried beef, potatoes and peas, lit the hand warmer John
  Place had given me, for it grew uncomfortably
chilly when the sun dropped below the horizon, and set off on a southeastward
course of 150°.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was determined
to get to the south shipping lanes before heading directly eastward.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We sailed all night at a delightful wave-slapping pace and
shortly after dawn arrived smack-dab in the middle of the lanes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were seven or eight ships in sight,
some headed east, others west; and as one left, another would appear to take
its place.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two identical black-hulled
trawlers came up over the sharp rim of the horizon and one of them picked up
its skirts and hurried over to examine <i>Tinkerbelle</i>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As it drew near, I heard music blaring from a
loudspeaker.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So that&#39;s what had passed by
invisibly but far from soundlessly in the fog on the second day of our voyage&#45;a
trawler.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When it got closer, I saw that
it was Russian, as was its sister ship.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>And its music reverberated just as deafeningly as had that of the
phantom ship in the fog. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>It was
wonderful classical music, mind you; there was nothing wrong with it except
that it was so loud it made the atmosphere quake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Russians must be avid photographers because when the trawler
drew to within fifty yards or so every member of the crew seemed to be on deck
with a camera pointed at <i>Tinkerbelle</i> and me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shutters clicked at a great rate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It reminded me of the time Virginia,
Robin, Douglas and I had becalmed in the channel to Presque Isle Bay at Erie and tourists in passing
excursion boats had snapped us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
time, however, I decided to join the fun:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I got out my own cameras, a 35-mm. still camera and a 16-mm movie job,
and clicked right back.</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p103">Page 103</A></FONT></P>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;<span class=SpellE>Tovarish</span>!&#34;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I yelled, using up with that one word fifty
per cent of my linguistic resources in conversational Russian.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And even that was a failure, apparently, for I got no
response.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Soviet fishermen smiled in
a friendly way, though, and when I waved they waved back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then they raced away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It was a perfect sun-drenched day, with a cloudless
turquoise sky and a lustrous blue sea.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The waves were just large enough to keep us moving along briskly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To all appearances we could have been on a
pleasant Sunday afternoon sail on Lake Pymatuning;
as a matter of fact, it <i>was</i> Sunday, June 6<sup>th</sup>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told myself that if most of the days ahead
were as pleasant as this, our trip would be a breeze, or, as the English say, a
piece of cake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>About midday I hove
<i>Tinkerbelle</i> to under sail and prepared a meal of dehydrated scrambled
eggs and bacon, with coffee, and ate it out in the cockpit where I could watch
the steady stream of ships going by to north and south.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We seemed to be on the blue-water center
strip of a multi-lane oceanic turnpike.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Trawlers, freighters and liners passed in processions that were exciting
to see.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>After I&#39;d finished off my meal with some canned pears, we
got under way again, still headed southeastward, and in the early afternoon met
another Russian trawler, this one white and much larger than the black trawlers
I&#39;d seen in the morning.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was slowly
hauling what must have been a huge net through the water.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No doubt the fishing was good, for the
trawlers were on the edge of Georges Bank, a fishing
ground that some authorities have rated next to the Grand Banks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Tinkerbelle</i> and I cut across the big ship&#39;s bow,
about two hundred yards ahead of it, and continued toward the southeast.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By the middle of the afternoon every ship was
out of sight; we were alone again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Moving so rapidly from an ocean teeming with ships to an ocean without
any ships in sight made the aloneness claw into my mind, creating a keen
awareness of my, I hoped, temporary separation from fellow humans.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was an intense feeling, but not an
especially unpleasant one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who has not
yearned with all his heart to leave the &#34;rat race&#34; and get</p>

<P ALIGN="RIGHT"><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="p104">Page 104</A></FONT></P>


<p class=MsoNormal>away from it all for a while?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was a privileged character; I was actually
doing what so many people longed to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No more rat race for me for at least a couple of months.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>During the afternoon I took another nap in the cockpit;
then, when we started moving again, it was on a due-east course of 90°.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That night I wrote in the log:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I saw a school of about eight whales after I resumed
sailing after my nap.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were too far
away for pictures, though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ve also
seen a lot of gulfweed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And quite a few
birds, which always seem to be too far away to photograph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I still don&#39;t know exactly where I am although I presume
(from my dead reckoning) I&#39;m near 40° N and 68° W.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;ll take some sextant sights tomorrow and
try to pinpoint it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I haven&#39;t seen a ship since leaving the lanes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The ocean is a vast empty expanse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m beginning to find out what real
loneliness is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;My nose is a bit sunburned and the backs of my hands are
getting raw from being wet so much and chafing against my cuffs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But my biggest problem is my <span
class=SpellE>bumteratum</span>, which is getting awfully sore from dampness and
constant jostling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I&#39;m sitting on the
life preserver cushion now and that helps, but tomorrow I&#39;ll have to render
some first aid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Otherwise I&#39;m in good shape.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Have been eating and drinking less than I
allowed for.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;But the cabin is a shambles.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everything is piled helter-skelter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trouble is, when I want something it&#39;s
usually under an assortment of other things and I have to get everything else
out of the way to get at it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And it goes
on and on like that.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I&#39;ve eaten
some of the food and drunk some of the water there will be more room and, I
hope, less mess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;The barometer has been holding steady at 30.8.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hope that means several days of good
weather.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Everything on board is now damp as can be, even these

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;At dusk we got into a tide rip, probably a tributary of the Gulf Stream.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some dolphins, the first I&#39;d seen, had been
following us, but they left us at the tide rip, unfortunately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I hove to the sea anchor at 11
 P.M. (Easter Standard Time)
and got about six hours&#39; sleep.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My log notations for the next day, June 7<sup>th</sup>,
were:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Had a nice big breakfast of hot cereal (cereal bars
crumbled into water and heated) hot coffee, fruit, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Then got moving.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was a glorious day of sailing:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>blue sky,
sunshine, wind and waves just right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><i>Tinkerbelle</i>
just scooted along.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Best of all, I finally got some good sun sights and
established our position&#45;40° 4&#39; N and 67° 31&#39; W.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is not as far along as I had hoped to be
at this time, but I had a couple of bad days there at the start and maybe I can
make up for them now.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;I&#39;m a little north of my planned route, too, but that may
be an advantage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Sighted quite a few whales&#45;all far off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&#34;Also sighted a ship to the north, which made me fearful
that I was too near the shipping lanes, so I turned south for a couple of
hours.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then hove to <span class=SpellE>to</span>
sleep.&#34;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I remembered that night well.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was worried because it was fogging up and I
no longer had a radar reflector with which to warn ships away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That made it difficult to rest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I lay awake in the cabin for a long time,
fretting, but in the end I dropped off to sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What helped was that I was warm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the first night I&#39;d been warm since
putting to sea, probably because we had moved out of the cold coastwise
currents from the north into the warmth of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That night I didn&#39;t shiver and shake as I had on all the
previous nights.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was cozy in the
cabin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a welcome change and a
very pleasant way to end my first week on the ocean.</p>
